# Token-Enabled Escrows and Payment Channels

The proposed amendment to the XRPL protocol, `PaychanAndEscrowForTokens`, would introduce changes to the ledger objects, transactions, and rpc methods to enable `Escrows` and `PayChannels` to use Trustline balances.

## 1. Problem Statement

The XRPL supports several types of on-ledger negotiable Instruments, namely: `Escows`, `PayChannels` and `Checks`. While each of these instruments is implemented as a first-class on-ledger object, only the `Check` object supports the use of Trustline balances. `PayChannels` and `Escrows` support only the native asset XRP. This limitation is a barrier to wider-spread use of these Instruments for reasons including:

- Regulatory compliance.
- Unwillingness to hold a counter-party-free asset (i.e. XRP).
- Volatility and exchange-rate risk.

## 2. Constraints

The amendment has the following constraints:

- Allow `Escrows` to use Trustline balances.
- Allow `PayChannels` to use Trustline balances.
- Allow Issuers to retain freeze and authorization control over their Issued tokens even when they are locked into Instruments.
- Avoid unnecessary multiplication of on-ledger entities.
- Avoid unnecessarily burdening the ledger computationally.

## 3. Implementation

An Instrument can only be created over a Trustline balance if both parties (source and destination):

- Are Authorised to hold the Trustline,
- Do not have a frozen Trustline for the issuer/currency pair, and
- Can ripple the balance through its Issuer.

The destination may not have a Trustline yet. This is not a bar to creating the Instrument provided that a hypothetical Trustline created at the same time the Instrument is created, from the destination account to the Issuer, for the relevant currency, would meet the above requirements.

Settlement of an Instrument (e.g. `EscrowFinish`, `PaymentChannelClaim`) carries the same semantics as crossing an offer: If no Trustline exists on the destination side, then a Trustline with zero limit is created and the tokens (balance) are placed into that line. However creation of a Trustline requires the transaction to be signed by the receiving account (because it creates an on-ledger object and increases the Owner Count and thus the XRP reserve locked by the destination account.)

### 3.1. New Field: `LockedBalance`.

If all or some of the Trustline balance is locked by a `PayChannel` or an `Escrow` then this amount is accounted for in the `LockedBalance` field. The Trustline Balance less the Locked Balance is the user's spendable balance for that asset. This may be zero if the whole balance is locked.

The rules for the LockedBalance field are as follows:

- If there is no LockedBalance on the Trustline then the LockedBalance is zero.
- If a LockedBalance reaches zero on the Trustline then the LockedBalance field is removed from the `RippleState` object and no longer takes up space on the ledger.
- A LockedBalance can never exceed the amount in the `Balance` field.
- A LockedBalance can never represent a negative balance..

For each Instrument (e.g. `Escrow`, `PayChan`) a user holds that locks up some tokens from a Trustline:

- Locking X tokens into the Instrument increases the LockedBalance on the Trustline by X.
- Upon settlement of the Instrument, both the LockedBalance and the Balance of the Trustline are together decremented by the amount of the settlement (and the Balance on the counter-party's Trustline is incremented by the settlement amount, less transaction fees).
- If the Instrument is cancelled in whole or in part, the amount returned to the first party is decremented from the LockedBalance.
- Multiple Instruments acting on the same Trustline accumulate toward the LockedBalance.

### 3.2. New Field: `LockCount`.

The LockCount field on a RippleState ledger object indicates the total number of locks held against the balance of the Trustline. This is always exactly the number of Instruments (e.g. `Escrows`, `PayChannels`) locking a non-zero amount of the Trustline balance. Adding an additional instrument increments the LockCount. Removing an instrument decrements the LockCount.

The LockCount field exists to account for any floating point *dust* that is left after the final instrument locking a trustline balance is released. If the LockCount reaches zero but the LockBalance is non-zero (typically extrtemely small) then the LockBalance is assumed to be zero, and is thus deleted.

### 3.3. New Field: `TransferRate`.

The TransferRate field on a `PayChannel` or `Escrow` ledger object indicates the current `TransferRate` at which the funds are locked.

The TransferRate is set at the time of instrument creation and is updated on subsequent funding/settlement events.

The TransferRate always favours the instrument holder. If the TransferRate is better than the current transfer rate for the asset, then settlement will occur at the better rate, and visa versa. If the current transfer rate is higher than the TransferRate then the preceding still applies but in the case of a PayChan no further PaymentChannelFund transactions are allowed.

### 3.4. The impact on Trustlines.

It is possible an Issuer causes an Instrument that uses some of their issued tokens to become frozen. They can do this by simply freezing their side of their Trustline with either of the parties to the Instrument. This prevents the Instrument from being resolved or cancelled until the freeze is lifted.

`Escrows` and `PayChannels` in this or any state are a bar to account deletion. Trustlines with LockedBalance (from any source) are also a bar to account deletion.

It is posssible for an Issuer to create a `PayChannel` or `Escrow` using their own token. The settlement of the Instrument follows the same guidlines as above.
