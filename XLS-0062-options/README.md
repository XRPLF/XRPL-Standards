## Amendment

The proposed amendment introduces a new framework for options trading on the XRPL protocol, providing a lightweight and flexible way to create, trade, and exercise options, thus expanding the financial capabilities of the XRPL for decentralized finance applications.

The amendment adds:

### New Ledger Entry Types

- **ltOPTION_PAIR** (`0x0083`): Represents an option listing for a specific asset/strike asset pair.
- **ltOPTION** (`0x0084`): Represents both an option listing (for a specific asset/strike asset pair) and a specific option contract.
- **ltOPTION_OFFER** (`0x0085`): Represents an offer to buy or sell an option contract.

### New Serialized Fields

- **sfStrikePrice** (`Amount`, code `32`): The strike price of the option.
- **sfExpiration** (`UInt32`): The expiration time of the option as a UNIX timestamp.
- **sfOptionPairID** (`Hash256`, code `35`): An identifier for the parent OptionPair.
- **sfOptionID** (`Hash256`, code `36`): An identifier for the `Option` object.
- **sfOptionOfferID** (`Hash256`, code `37`): An identifier for the `OptionOffer` object.
- **sfQuantity** (`UInt32`, code `53`): The quantity of options (number of contracts).
- **sfOpenInterest** (`UInt32`, code `52`): The quantity of options available (unsealed amount).
- **sfPremium** (`Amount`, code `33`): The premium amount per option contract.
- **sfSealedOption** (`Object`, code `34`): An object representing a sealed (matched) option between counterparties.
- **sfSealedOptions** (`Array`, code `29`): An array of `sfSealedOption` objects in an `OptionOffer`.

### New Transaction Types

- **OptionPairCreate** (`ttOPTION_PAIR_CREATE`, code `64`): Creates a new pseudo account for an option listing with a specific asset/asset2 pair.
- **OptionCreate** (`ttOPTION_CREATE`, code `64`): Creates a new option offer for an existing option contract.
- **OptionSettle** (`ttOPTION_SETTLE`, code `65`): Settles an option contract through exercise, expiration, or closing.

### New Transaction Flags

#### For OptionCreate Transactions

- **tfPut** (`0x00010000`): Indicates a Put option (default is Call if unset).
- **tfMarket** (`0x00020000`): Indicates a Market order (default is Limit if unset).
- **tfSell** (`0x00080000`): Indicates a Sell offer (default is Buy if unset).
- **Mask:** `tfOptionCreateMask = ~(tfUniversal | tfPut | tfMarket | tfSell)`

#### For OptionSettle Transactions

- **tfExpire** (`0x00010000`): Indicates intent to expire the option.
- **tfClose** (`0x00020000`): Indicates intent to close the option.
- **tfExercise** (`0x00040000`): Indicates intent to exercise the option.
- **Mask:** `tfOptionSettleMask = ~(tfUniversal | tfExpire | tfClose | tfExercise)`

## Pseudo Account Approach for Options

Each option listing is represented by a pseudo account without an owner, similar to the AMM implementation. This creates consistency in the XRPL protocol for derivative products.

### Option Pair Pseudo Account Creation and Identification

1. The `OptionPairCreate` transaction creates a new `AccountRoot` object and associated `OptionPair` object for a specific asset/asset2 pair (e.g., GME/USD).
2. The `OptionPairID` is the AccountID of the pseudo account.
3. The master key is disabled and the regular key is set to account zero, making it impossible for the account to originate transactions.

## New Ledger Object Type: `OptionPair`

The `OptionPair` ledger object represents an option listing for a specific asset/asset2 pair on the XRPL. This object is created when an `OptionPairCreate` transaction is processed.

### Fields

```

## New Transaction Type: `OptionPairCreate`

The `OptionPairCreate` transaction is used to create a new option listing for a specific asset/asset2 pair on the XRPL by creating a dedicated pseudo account for the option listing. This establishes the option listing parameters and creates the necessary ledger objects.

### Fields

| Field             | Type      | Required | Description                                                  |

| `Account`         | AccountID | Required | The account creating the option listing.                     |
| `Asset`           | Issue     | Required | The underlying asset of the option (an `Issue` structure).   |
| `Asset2`          | Issue     | Required | The strike price asset of the option (an `Issue` structure). |

### Failure Conditions

The `OptionPairCreate` transaction **MUST** fail if:

- The transaction does not meet the generic transaction requirements.
- The `Asset` field is missing or invalid.
- The `Asset2` field is missing or invalid.
- An option listing with identical parameters (same Asset and Asset2) already exists.

### State Changes

If the transaction is successful:

- A new `AccountRoot` object is created for the option listing.
- The regular key is set to account zero, and the master key is disabled for the `AccountRoot`.
- A new `OptionPair` object is created with the specified parameters, linked to the `AccountRoot`.
- A new `DirectoryNode` object is created linking the `AccountRoot` and `OptionPair` objects.
- The `OptionPairID` is the AccountID of the new pseudo account.

### Example `OptionPairCreate` Transaction

```json
{
  "TransactionType": "OptionPairCreate",
  "Account": "rAccountCreatingTheListing",
  "Asset": {
    "currency": "GME",
    "issuer": "rGMEissuerAddress"
  },
  "Asset2": {
    "currency": "USD",
    "issuer": "rUSDissuerAddress"
  }
}
```

## New Transaction Type: `OptionCreate`

The `OptionCreate` transaction is used to create a new option offer on the XRPL for an existing option contract (identified by its `OptionID`).

### Fields

| Field             | Type      | Required | Description                                                              |
| ----------------- | --------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `TransactionType` | UInt16    | Required | The type of transaction (`OptionCreate`, value `64`).                    |
| `Account`         | AccountID | Required | The account creating the option offer.                                   |
| `OptionID`        | Hash256   | Required | The ID of the existing Option (AccountID of the option pseudo account).  |
| `Premium`         | Amount    | Required | The premium per option contract.                                         |
| `Quantity`        | UInt32    | Required | The quantity of options (number of contracts). Must be divisible by 100. |
| `Flags`           | UInt32    | Optional | Flags to specify action (see below).                                     |

### `OptionCreate` Flags

The `OptionCreate` transaction uses flags to specify the type of option offer.

| Flag Name  | Hex Value    | Description                                   |
| ---------- | ------------ | --------------------------------------------- |
| `tfMarket` | `0x00020000` | Set for Market order (unset for Limit order). |
| `tfSell`   | `0x00080000` | Set for Sell option (unset for Buy).          |

The mask for valid flags is:

- `tfOptionCreateMask = ~(tfUniversal | tfMarket | tfSell)`

### Failure Conditions

The `OptionCreate` transaction **MUST** fail if:

- The transaction does not meet the generic transaction requirements.
- The `OptionID` field is missing or invalid.
- The specified `Option` does not exist.
- The `Premium` field is missing, invalid, or improperly formatted.
- The `Quantity` field is missing, invalid, not divisible by 100, or zero.
- The account does not have sufficient balance to cover the premium (for buyers) or does not have sufficient collateral (for sellers).
- Invalid flags are set (flags outside of `tfOptionCreateMask`).
- The option has expired (current ledger time is past the expiration).
- Any amount calculations result in an overflow or underflow.

### State Changes

If the transaction is successful:

- An `OptionOffer` ledger object is created with the specified parameters.
- The account's owner count is incremented.
- For buyers:
  - If the option is matched with a seller (sealed), the open interest is adjusted, and sealed options are recorded.
- For sellers:
  - The collateral (underlying asset) is locked in the `OptionOffer` object.
  - If the option is matched with a buyer, the premium is credited to the seller's balance, open interest is adjusted, and sealed options are recorded.
- Premium payments are transferred between buyers and sellers for matched (sealed) options.
- The transaction fee is deducted from the account's balance.

### Example `OptionCreate` Transaction (Buy Call)

```json
{
  "TransactionType": "OptionCreate",
  "Account": "rBuyerAccount",
  "OptionID": "rOPTIONaccountAddress",
  "Premium": {
    "currency": "USD",
    "issuer": "rUSDissuer",
    "value": "0.5"
  },
  "Quantity": 100,
  "Flags": 0 // Buy (tfSell unset), Limit (tfMarket unset)
}
```

## New Transaction Type: `OptionSettle`

The `OptionSettle` transaction is used to settle an option contract on the XRPL. This transaction allows the holder of a call or put option to exercise their right to buy or sell the underlying asset at the specified strike price, or to expire or close the option.

### Fields

| Field             | Type      | Required | Description                                                       |
| ----------------- | --------- | -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `TransactionType` | UInt16    | Required | The type of transaction (`OptionSettle`, value `65`).             |
| `Account`         | AccountID | Required | The account settling the option.                                  |
| `OptionID`        | Hash256   | Required | The ID of the `Option` (AccountID of the option pseudo account).  |
| `OptionOfferID`   | Hash256   | Required | The ID of the `OptionOffer` ledger object representing the offer. |
| `Flags`           | UInt32    | Required | Flags indicating the settlement action (exactly one must be set). |

### `OptionSettle` Flags

| Flag Name    | Hex Value    | Description                       |
| ------------ | ------------ | --------------------------------- |
| `tfExpire`   | `0x00010000` | Set to expire the option.         |
| `tfClose`    | `0x00020000` | Set to close the option position. |
| `tfExercise` | `0x00040000` | Set to exercise the option.       |

The mask for valid flags is:

- `tfOptionSettleMask = ~(tfUniversal | tfExpire | tfClose | tfExercise)`

**Note:** Exactly one of these flags must be set.

### Failure Conditions

The `OptionSettle` transaction **MUST** fail if:

- The transaction does not meet the generic transaction requirements.
- The `OptionID` field is missing or invalid.
- The `OptionOfferID` field is missing or invalid.
- The `Option` ledger object or the `OptionOffer` ledger object does not exist.
- The account is not the owner of the option offer (does not have permission to settle it).
- More than one settlement flag is set or no settlement flag is set.
- Invalid flags are set (flags outside of `tfOptionSettleMask`).
- For `tfExercise`:
  - The option cannot be exercised by a seller (only buyers can exercise).
  - The account does not have sufficient balance to cover the cost of exercising.
- For `tfClose`:
  - No suitable replacement offers can be found to maintain sealed option relationships.

### State Changes

If the transaction is successful:

- For expiration (`tfExpire`):
  - If the option has already expired naturally or the flag is set:
    - Any locked collateral (for sell offers) is returned to the owner.
    - The `OptionOffer` is removed from the ledger.
    - Counterparty options are updated to remove references to the expired offer.
  - The transaction returns `tecEXPIRED`.

- For closing (`tfClose`):
  - The option position is closed, potentially replacing sealed option relationships with new counterparties.
  - For sell offers, locked collateral is returned to the owner.
  - For buy offers that have sealed options, payments may be received from new counterparties.
  - The `OptionOffer` is removed from the ledger.

- For exercising (`tfExercise`):
  - Assets and funds are transferred between the holder (buyer) and the writer (seller):
    - For a **Call Option Exercise**:
      - The holder pays the strike price amount (total value) to the writer.
      - The writer transfers the underlying asset (quantity of shares) to the holder.
    - For a **Put Option Exercise**:
      - The holder transfers the underlying asset (quantity of shares) to the writer.
      - The writer pays the strike price amount (total value) to the holder.
  - The `OptionOffer` is removed from the ledger after successful exercise.

### Example `OptionSettle` Transaction (Exercise)

```json
{
  "TransactionType": "OptionSettle",
  "Account": "rBuyerAccount",
  "OptionID": "rOPTIONaccountAddress",
  "OptionOfferID": "D5EB856370B233B4384D02613E6C71305C57BCA5FF4A5D857D4628DB9D72BC55",
  "Flags": 65536 // tfExercise flag set (0x00040000)
}
```

## Option Order Book

An option order book is maintained in the ledger to facilitate the matching of option offers. The order book indexes `OptionOffer` ledger objects based on the `OptionID` and sorts them by `Premium` using `OptionQuality`. This allows for efficient discovery and matching of compatible offers.

### Order Book Indexing

Offers are organized in directories similar to the existing `Offer` objects for trading currencies. The key differences are:

- **Option Parameters**: The directory keys include the `OptionID` and the quality (premium).
- **Quality (OptionQuality)**: The premium per option contract is used as the quality for sorting offers within the directories.

The methods for indexing include:

- `getOptionBookBase`: Generates the base index for the option order book directory.
- `getOptionQualityNext`: Determines the next quality index for iteration.
- `getOptionQuality`: Retrieves the quality (premium) component from an index.

These methods facilitate the navigation and management of the option order book within the ledger.

### Matching Option Offers

When an `OptionCreate` transaction is processed, the ledger attempts to match the new `OptionOffer` with existing offers in the order book. Offers are matched based on option parameters and premiums. When a match occurs, the offers are sealed, and the `SealedOptions` arrays in the respective `OptionOffer` objects are updated to reflect the matched quantities and counterparties.

## RPC Changes

A new RPC method `option_book_offers` is introduced, enabling clients to query the current state of the option order book for a specific option. This allows users to retrieve active offers for buying or selling options, facilitating market transparency and price discovery.
