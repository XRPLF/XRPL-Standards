# Permissioned DEXes

## Abstract

Decentralized Exchanges (DEXes) are revolutionizing finance due to their ability to offer significant benefits such as intermediary elimination, lower transaction costs, enhanced security, and user asset custody. These advantages align perfectly with the growing demand for efficient financial systems. However, a major hurdle hinders wider adoption by traditional institutions: the anonymity of a DEX makes it difficult to comply with Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Know Your Customer (KYC) regulations.

This challenge highlights a critical need for the development of a permissioned system within DEXes. Such a system would allow institutions to adhere to regulations while still benefiting from the core advantages of blockchain technology.

This proposal introduces a permissioned DEX system for the XRPL. By integrating permissioning features directly within the DEX protocol, regulated financial institutions gain the ability to participate in the XRPL's DEX while still adhering to their compliance requirements. This approach avoids the drawbacks of isolated, permissioned tokens or private blockchains, ensuring a vibrant and liquid marketplace that facilitates seamless arbitrage opportunities. Ultimately, this permissioned DEX system paves the way for wider institutional adoption of XRPL, fostering a more inclusive and efficient financial landscape.

## 1. Overview

This proposal builds on top of [XLS-80d, Permissioned Domains](https://github.com/XRPLF/XRPL-Standards/tree/master/XLS-0080d-permissioned-domains), as Permissioned Domains are needed to handle the permissioning aspect.

We propose:
* Modifying the `Offer` ledger object.
* Modifying the `OfferCreate` transaction.
* Modifying the `Payment` transaction.

This feature will require an amendment, tentatively titled `featurePermissionedDEX`. The the orderbook and pathing-related RPCs will also need to be updated.

### 1.1. Background: The Current State of Permissioning and Compliance on the XRPL
The XRPL has made significant strides toward a compliance-by-design framework, incorporating several features to enhance transparency and control. These tools aim to facilitate regulatory adherence while preserving the platform's decentralized ethos.

They include:

* **Deposit Auth:** Offers granular control over incoming funds, allowing issuers to define specific conditions for accepting deposits.
* **Authorized Trustlines:** Enables precise management of asset trustlines, providing issuers with greater oversight over asset distribution.
* **Clawback:** Provides a mechanism for issuers to reclaim issued assets under specific circumstances, enhancing control and risk mitigation.
* **Freezing:** Allows accounts to be restricted from sending or receiving funds, aiding in compliance with regulatory requirements.
* **Multisign:** Introduces additional layers of authorization, enhancing security and compliance for sensitive transactions.
* **Payment Paths:** Offers flexible transaction routing, which can be leveraged for compliance purposes, such as ensuring funds pass through specific intermediaries.

While these features provide an excellent foundation for compliance, they fall short in one crucial area: the use of the DEX. 

### 1.2. Terminology

* **Offer Crossing**: Two offers **cross** if one is selling a token at a price that's actually lower than or equal to the price the other is offering to buy it at.
* **Offer Filling**: Two offers **fill** each other if the trade executes and the sale goes through. Offers can be partially filled, based on the flags (settings) of the offers.
* **Permissioned DEX**: The subset of the DEX that operates within the rules of a specific domain.
* **Open DEX**: The un-permissioned DEX that has no restrictions.
* **Permissioned Orderbook**: An orderbook that operates within the rules of a specific domain.
* **Open Orderbook**: An un-permissioned orderbook that has no restrictions.
* **Permissioned Offer/Payment** or **Closed Offer/Payment**: An offer/cross-currency payment that can only be filled by offers that are a part of a specific domain.
* **Open Offer/Payment** or **Unpermissioned Offer/Payment**: An offer/cross-currency payment that is able to trade on the open DEX or potentially in permissioned DEXes, but doesn't have any restrictions itself.
* **Valid Domain Offer/Payment**: An offer/cross-currency payment that satisfies the rules of a domain (i.e. the account is a domain member). This must be a permissioned offer.

### 1.3. Basic Flow

#### 1.3.1. Initial Setup
* Owen, a domain owner, creates his domain with a set of KYC credentials.
* Tracy, a trader, is operating in Owen's regulatory environment and has strict regulatory requirements - she cannot receive liquidity from non-KYCed accounts. She has one of Owen's accepted KYC credentials, and will only be placing permissioned offers.
* Marko, a market maker, wants to arbitrage offers in Owen's domain, as there is often a significant price difference inside and outside. He obtains one of the KYC credentials that Owen's domain accepts. He will be placing both permissioned _and_ open offers.

#### 1.3.2. Trading Scenario 1

* Tracy places a permissioned offer on the XRP-USD orderbook. There are no other offers on that orderbook that are a part of the domain.
* Marko notices that there is a significant price difference between Tracy's offer and the rest of the orderbook. He now submits a permissioned offer to cross and fill Tracy's offer.

#### 1.3.3. Trading Scenario 2
* Marko has placed open offers on the XRP-EUR orderbook.
* Tracy places an offer on the XRP-EUR orderbook that crosses one of Marko's offers. Her offer cannot be filled by his, since hers is a permissioned offer and his is an open offer.

### 1.4. How Domains Work

A permissioned offer will only be filled by valid domain offers.

An open offer can be filled by any open offer on the open DEX, but cannot be filled by a permissioned offer. Likewise, any permissioned offer cannot be filled by an open offer.

## 2. On-Ledger Object: `Offer`

The `Offer` object tracks an offer placed on the CLOB DEX. This object type already exists on the XRPL, but is being extended as a part of this spec to also support permissioned DEX domains.

### 2.1. Fields

<details>
<summary>

As a reference, [here](https://xrpl.org/docs/references/protocol/ledger-data/ledger-entry-types/offer) are the existing fields for the `Offer` object.
</summary>

| Field Name | Required? | JSON Type | Internal Type | Description |
|------------|-----------|-----------|---------------|-------------|
|`Account`|✔️|`string`|`AccountID`|The address of the account that owns this offer.|
|`BookDirectory`|✔️|`string`|`Hash256`|The ID of the offer directory that links to this offer.|
|`BookNode`|✔️|`string`|`UInt64`|A hint indicating which page of the offer directory links to this entry, in case the directory consists of multiple pages.|
|`Expiration`| |`number`|`UInt32`|Indicates the time after which this offer is considered unfunded.|
|`LedgerEntryType`|✔️|`string`|`UInt16`|The value `0x006F`, mapped to the string `Offer`, indicates that this is an offer entry.|
|`OwnerNode`|✔️|`string`|`UInt64`|A hint indicating which page of the owner directory links to this entry, in case the directory consists of multiple pages.|
|`PreviousTxnID`|✔️|`string`|`Hash256`|The identifying hash of the transaction that most recently modified this entry.|
|`PreviousTxnLgrSeq`|✔️|`number`|`UInt32`|The ledger index that contains the transaction that most recently modified this object.|
|`Sequence`|✔️|`number`|`UInt32`|The `Sequence` value of the `OfferCreate` transaction that created this offer. Used in combination with the `Account` to identify this offer.|
|`TakerPays`|✔️|`object`|`Amount`|The remaining amount and type of currency requested by the offer creator.|
|`TakerGets`|✔️|`object`|`Amount`|The remaining amount and type of currency being provided by the offer creator.|
</details>

This spec proposes deprecating the `BookDirectory` and `BookNode` fields and adding the following:

| Field Name | Required? | JSON Type | Internal Type | Description |
|------------|-----------|-----------|---------------|-------------|
|`DomainID`| |`string`|`Hash256`|The domain that the offer must be a part of.|
|`BookDirectories`|✔️|`string`|`Vector256`|The IDs of the offer directories that link to this offer.|
|`BookNodes`|✔️|`string`|`STArray`|Hints indicating which pages of the offer directory links to this entry, in case the directories consist of multiple pages.|

#### 2.1.1. `DomainID`

A permissioned offer has a `DomainID` field included.

An open offer does not include a `DomainID` field.

### 2.2. Offer Invalidity

A permissioned offer on the orderbook can become invalid if:
* The domain specified by the `DomainID` field is deleted.
* The credential that allows the offer's owner to be a member of the domain expires or is deleted.

An invalid offer will be processed similarly to an unfunded offer, where it is deleted if and when processed/crossed.

## 3. On-Ledger Object: `DirectoryNode`

The `Offer` object tracks an offer placed on the CLOB DEX. 

The `DirectoryNode` ledger entry type provides a list of links to other entries in the ledger's state data. A single conceptual _Directory_ takes the form of a doubly linked list, with one or more `DirectoryNode` entries each containing up to 32 [IDs of other entries](https://xrpl.org/docs/references/protocol/ledger-data/common-fields/). The first `DirectoryNode` entry is called the root of the directory, and all entries other than the root can be added or deleted as necessary.

This object type already exists on the XRPL, but is being extended as a part of this spec to also support permissioned DEX domains.

There are three types of [directories](https://xrpl.org/docs/references/protocol/ledger-data/ledger-entry-types/directorynode): owner directories (for the objects an account owns), offer directories (for offers in the orderbook), and NFT offer directories (for NFT offers). The proposed modifications only concern offer directories.

### 3.1. Fields

<details>
<summary>

As a reference, [here](https://xrpl.org/docs/references/protocol/ledger-data/ledger-entry-types/directorynode#directorynode-fields) are the existing fields for the `DirectoryNode` object.
</summary>

| Field Name | Required? | JSON Type | Internal Type | Description |
|------------|-----------|-----------|---------------|-------------|
|`Flags`|✔️|`number`|`UInt32`|A bit-map of boolean flags enabled for this object. Currently, the protocol defines no flags for `DirectoryNode` objects. The value is always `0`.|
|`Indexes`|✔️|`array`|`Vector256`|The contents of this directory: an array of IDs of other objects.|
|`IndexNext`| |`number`|`UInt64`|If this directory consists of multiple pages, this ID links to the next object in the chain, wrapping around at the end.|
|`IndexPrevious`| |`number`|`UInt64`|If this directory consists of multiple pages, this ID links to the previous object in the chain, wrapping around at the beginning.|
|`LedgerEntryType`|✔️|`string`|`UInt16`|The value `0x0064`, mapped to the string `DirectoryNode`, indicates that this object is part of a directory.|
|`RootIndex`|✔️|`string`|`Hash256`|The ID of root object for this directory.|
|`TakerGetsCurrency`|✔️|`string`|`Hash160`|The currency code of the `TakerGets` amount from the offers in this directory.|
|`TakerGetsIssuer`|✔️|`string`|`Hash160`|The issuer of the `TakerGets` amount from the offers in this directory.|
|`TakerPaysCurrency`|✔️|`string`|`Hash160`|The currency code of the `TakerPays` amount from the offers in this directory.|
|`TakerPaysIssuer`|✔️|`string`|`Hash160`|The issuer of the `TakerPays` amount from the offers in this directory.|
</details>

This spec proposes these additions:

| Field Name | Required? | JSON Type | Internal Type | Description |
|------------|-----------|-----------|---------------|-------------|
|`DomainID`| |`string`|`Hash256`|The domain that the offer directory is a part of.|

#### 3.1.1. `DomainID`

A domain has its own set of orderbooks.

### 3.2. Object ID

_The proposed modification is in bold._

There are three different formulas for creating the ID of a DirectoryNode, depending on which of the following the DirectoryNode represents:

* The first page (also called the root) of an Owner or NFT Offer directory
* The first page of an Offer directory
* Later pages of either type

The first page of an Offer directory has a special ID: the higher 192 bits define the order book, and the remaining 64 bits define the exchange rate of the offers in that directory. (The ID is big-endian, so the book is in the more significant bits, which come first, and the quality is in the less significant bits which come last.) This provides a way to iterate through an order book from best offers to worst. Specifically: the first 192 bits are the first 192 bits of the [SHA-512Half](https://xrpl.org/docs/references/protocol/data-types/basic-data-types#hashes) of the following values, concatenated in order:

* The Book directory space key (`0x0042`)
* The 160-bit currency code from the `TakerPaysCurrency`
* The 160-bit currency code from the `TakerGetsCurrency`
* The AccountID from the `TakerPaysIssuer`
* The AccountID from the `TakerGetsIssuer`
* **The `DomainID` of the orderbook, if applicable**

The lower 64 bits of an Offer directory's ID represent the `TakerPays` amount divided by `TakerGets` amount from the offer(s) in that directory as a 64-bit number in the XRP Ledger's internal amount format.

If the DirectoryNode is not the first page in the directory, it has an ID that is the [SHA-512Half](https://xrpl.org/docs/references/protocol/data-types/basic-data-types#hashes) of the following values, concatenated in order:

* The DirectoryNode space key (`0x0064`)
* The ID of the root DirectoryNode
* The page number of this object. (Since 0 is the root DirectoryNode, this value is an integer 1 or higher.)

## 4. Transaction: `OfferCreate`

The `OfferCreate` transaction creates an offer on the CLOB DEX. This transaction type already exists on the XRPL, but is being extended as a part of this spec to also support permissioned DEX domains.

### 4.1. Fields

<details>
<summary>

As a reference, [here](https://xrpl.org/docs/references/protocol/transactions/types/offercreate) are the existing fields for the `OfferCreate` transaction.
</summary>

| Field Name | Required? | JSON Type | Internal Type | Description |
|------------|-----------|-----------|---------------|-------------|
|`Expiration`| |`number`|`UInt32`|Time after which the offer is no longer active, in seconds since the Ripple Epoch.|
|`OfferSequence`| |`number`|`UInt32`|An offer to delete first, specified in the same way as `OfferCancel`.|
|`TakerGets`|✔️|`string`|`Amount`|The amount and type of currency being sold.|
|`TakerPays`|✔️|`string`|`Amount`|The amount and type of currency being bought.|
</details>

We propose these additions:

| Field Name | Required? | JSON Type | Internal Type | Description |
|------------|-----------|-----------|---------------|-------------|
|`DomainID`| |`string`|`Hash256`|The domain that the offer must be a part of.|

#### 4.1.1. `Flags`

This spec proposes an additional flag, to indicate whether the offer should consider only the `DomainID`'s Permissioned DEX or also include the open DEX.

### 4.2. Failure Conditions

The existing set of failure conditions for `OfferCreate` will continue to exist.

The following will be added, if the `DomainID` field is included:
* The domain doesn't exist.
* The offer is not a valid domain offer.

### 4.3. State Changes

The existing set of state changes for `OfferCreate` will continue to exist.

If the `DomainID` is included in the `OfferCreate` transaction, the DEX will use the domain-specific orderbook to process the offer.

## 5. Transaction: `Payment`

A `Payment` transaction represents a transfer of value from one account to another, and can involve currency conversions and crossing the orderbook. This transaction type already exists on the XRPL, but is being extended as a part of this spec to also support permissioned DEX domains.

### 5.1. Fields

<details>
<summary>

As a reference, [here](https://xrpl.org/docs/references/protocol/transactions/types/payment) are the existing fields for the `Payment` transaction.
</summary>

| Field Name | Required? | JSON Type | Internal Type | Description |
|------------|-----------|-----------|---------------|-------------|
|`Amount`|✔️|`string`|`Amount`|The maximum amount of currency to deliver. For non-XRP amounts, the nested field names MUST be lower-case. If the `tfPartialPayment` flag is set, deliver _up to_ this amount instead.|
|`DeliverMin`| |`string`|`Amount`|The minimum amount of destination currency this transaction should deliver. Only valid if this is a partial payment. For non-XRP amounts, the nested field names are lower-case.|
|`Destination`|✔️|`string`|`AccountID`|The unique address of the account receiving the payment.|
|`DestinationTag`| |`number`|`UInt32`|An arbitrary tag that identifies the reason for the payment to the destination, or a hosted recipient to pay.|

|`SendMax` | |`string` or `object`|`Amount`|Highest amount of source currency this transaction is allowed to cost, including transfer fees, exchange rates, and [slippage](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slippage_%28finance%29). Does not include the XRP destroyed as a cost for submitting the transaction. For non-XRP amounts, the nested field names MUST be lower-case. Must be supplied for cross-currency/cross-issue payments. Must be omitted for XRP-to-XRP payments.|
</details>

We propose these additions:

| Field Name | Required? | JSON Type | Internal Type | Description |
|------------|-----------|-----------|---------------|-------------|
|`DomainID`| |`string`|`Hash256`|The domain that the offer must be a part of.|

#### 5.1.1. `DomainID`

The `DomainID` can only be included if the payment is a cross-currency payment (i.e. if the payment is going to interact with the DEX). It should only be included if the payment is permissioned.

#### 5.1.2. `Flags`

This spec proposes an additional flag, to indicate whether the offer should consider only the `DomainID`'s Permissioned DEX or also include the open DEX.

### 5.2. Failure Conditions

The existing set of failure conditions for `Payment` will continue to exist.

There will also be the following in addition, if the `DomainID` is included:
* The payment isn't a cross-currency payment.
* The domain doesn't exist.
* The `Account` is not a domain member.
* The currencies used in `Amount`, `SendMax`, and `DeliverMin` are not permitted as a part of the domain's rules.
* The paths do not satisfy the domain's rules (e.g. a path includes a currency that isn't allowed to be part of the domain).

### 5.3. State Changes

The existing set of state changes for a successful `Payment` transaction will continue to exist.

## 6. RPC: `book_offers`

As a reference, here are the fields that the [`book_changes` subscription currently returns](https://xrpl.org/docs/references/http-websocket-apis/public-api-methods/subscription-methods/subscribe#book-changes-stream):

This proposal puts forward the following addition:

| Field Name | Required? | JSON Type | Description |
|------------|-----------|-----------|-------------|
|`domain`| |`string`|The object ID of a `PermissionedDomain` object, if the orderbook changes are for a specific domain.|

## 11. Examples

These examples will be using the following domain:

```typescript
{
  Owner: "rOWEN......",
  Sequence: 5,
  AcceptedCredentials: [
    Credential: {
      Issuer: "rISABEL......",
      CredentialType: "123ABC"
    }
  ]
}
```

The domain ID will be `ABCDEF1234567890`.

Both Tracy and Marko have a `123ABC` credential from Isabel.

### 11.1. Placing a Permissioned Offer

In this sample `OfferCreate` transaction, Tracy is trading USD for EUR within Owen's domain.

```typescript
{
  TransactionType: "OfferCreate",
  Account: "rTRACY......",
  TakerGets: {
    currency: "USD",
    issuer: "rUSDISSUER.......",
    value: "11"
  },
  TakerPays: {
    currency: "EUR",
    issuer: "rEURISSUER......."
    value: "10"
  },
  DomainID: "ABCDEF1234567890",
  Fee: "12",
  Sequence: 8
}
```

### 11.2. Placing an Unpermissioned Offer

In this sample `OfferCreate` transaction, Marko is trading EUR for USD on the open USD-EUR orderbook. This offer **will not cross** Tracy's offer, since Tracy's offer is inside the domain.

```typescript
{
  TransactionType: "OfferCreate",
  Account: "rMARKO......",
  TakerGets: {
    currency: "EUR",
    issuer: "rEURISSUER.......",
    value: "10"
  },
  TakerPays: {
    currency: "USD",
    issuer: "rUSDISSUER......."
    value: "11"
  },
  Fee: "12",
  Sequence: 3
}
```

## 12. Invariants

No permissioned offer with a `DomainID` field will be filled by:
* An invalid domain offer.
* An offer from a different domain.
* An open offer.

No permissioned offer will be placed in:
* An orderbook for a different domain.
* The open orderbook.

No open offer will be placed in a permissioned orderbook.

No open offer will be filled by a permissioned offer.

## 13. Security

The trust assumptions are the same as with permissioned domains.

## n+1. Open Questions

* Does a permissioned offer need to be able to be part of multiple domains? If so, the `DomainID` field should be replaced with a `DomainIDs` field (to accommodate a list)

# Appendix

## Appendix A: FAQ

### A.1: How are AMMs handled?

AMMs are not explicitly supported within permissioned DEXes in this proposal. They could be added to permissioned DEXes in a future proposal.

### A.2: How will performance/TPS be affected from all these additional checks?

Performance tests will need to be conducted once the implementation is done. The spec may be modified if such tests show serious performance reduction.

### A.3: Why do you need a domain? Why not just indicate what credentials you accept on the offer itself?

It's much easier to specify a single domain instead of a list of credentials every time, especially since using an incorrect list of credentials would result in accessing a different orderbook.

### A.4: Will an account with Deposit Authorization enabled be forced to use Permissioned DEXes? 

No.

### A.5: Can NFT offers use domains?

This proposal does not include support for NFT offers in domains. However, that could be added later.

### A.6: Can an offer be part of multiple domains?

No, multiple offers would need to be placed for it to be in multiple domains.

### A.7: Can direct IOU payments be permissioned?

No, because they don't go through the DEX. The issuer and destination can be directly verified for compliance and trust.

## Appendix B: Alternate Designs

The Platonic ideal design would involve one orderbook per pair of assets. The trader indicates what domain they want to participate in, and the DEX automatically figures out what offers are okay for that domain to accept and what offers are not, based on the contents of the offer and the account that placed it.

This was essentially one design considered, which involved all of the offers staying in one orderbook. If an offer needed to be in a domain, each offer that crossed it would be checked for offer membership individually (in the same way that offers are checked on whether they're funded). This idea was scrapped due to performance concerns - a permissioned offer might have to iterate through the whole orderbook before finding a matching offer (if one exists).
