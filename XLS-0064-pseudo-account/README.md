### Abstract

This document proposes a standard for a *pseudo-account*, an `AccountRoot` ledger entry that can be associated with one or more other ledger entries. A pseudo-account is designed to hold and/or issue assets on behalf of its associated entries, enabling protocol-level functionality that requires an on-ledger entity to manage funds.

### Motivation

The XRP Ledger is an account-based system where assets (XRP, IOUs, etc.) can only be held by an `AccountRoot` entry. However, several advanced protocols, such as Automated Market Makers (AMMs), lending pools, and vaults, require a ledger *object* itself to hold and manage assets.

The [XLS-30 (AMM)](https://github.com/XRPLF/XRPL-Standards/tree/master/XLS-0030-automated-market-maker#readme) specification pioneered this concept by introducing a pseudo-account linked to each `AMM` instance. This allows the AMM to track its token balances and issue Liquidity Provider Tokens (`LPTokens`).

This specification formalizes and standardizes the requirements for an `AccountRoot` when it functions as a pseudo-account, ensuring a consistent and secure implementation across different protocols. It defines mandatory flags, a naming convention for linking fields, and the core invariants that any protocol using a pseudo-account must enforce.

### Specification

#### Ledger Entries

This specification defines a set of mandatory properties and fields for an `AccountRoot` ledger entry when it is used as a pseudo-account.

##### **`AccountRoot`**

###### **Object Identifier**

The address of the pseudo-account's `AccountRoot` must be derived deterministically and be difficult to predict before creation. This prevents malicious actors from front-running the creation transaction by pre-funding the address. The protocol creating the `AccountRoot` must ensure the derived address is unoccupied.

A nonce-based approach is used to generate the unique `AccountRoot` ID:

1. Initialize a nonce, $i$, to $0$.
2. Compute a candidate ID: `AccountID` = `SHA512-Half`($i$ || `ParentLedgerHash` || `<ObjectID>`).
3. Check if an `AccountRoot` with this `AccountID` already exists on the ledger.
4. If it exists, increment the nonce $i$ and repeat from step 2.
5. If it does not exist, the computed `AccountID` is used for the new pseudo-account.

###### **Fields**

| Field Name | Constant | Required | Internal Type | Default Value | Description |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :--- |
| `<Object>ID` | Yes | Yes | `HASH256` | N/A | The unique identifier of the ledger object this pseudo-account is associated with. |
| `Flags` | Yes | Yes | `UINT32` | N/A | A set of flags that must be set for a pseudo-account. |
| `Sequence` | Yes | Yes | `UINT32` | `0` | The sequence number, which must be `0`. |
| `RegularKey` | Yes | No | `ACCOUNT` | N/A | A regular key, which must not be set for a pseudo-account. |

A detailed description of these fields follows:

**`<Object>ID`**

This field links the pseudo-account to its parent ledger object. Any protocol introducing a pseudo-account must define a new, optional field on the `AccountRoot` object to store this ID. The field name must follow this convention:

* `<Object>` is the name of the associated ledger object (e.g., `AMM`, `Vault`). Names that are acronyms should be fully capitalized (`AMMID`). Otherwise, use PascalCase (`VaultID`).
* The suffix `ID` must always be appended.

**`Flags`**

The following flags must be set on a pseudo-account's `AccountRoot` and must be immutable:

| Flag Name | Hex Value | Description |
| :--- | :---: | :--- |
| `lsfDisableMaster` | `0x00040000` | Disables the master key pair, ensuring no entity can sign transactions directly for this account. Control is ceded entirely to protocol rules. |
| `lsfDepositAuth` | `0x01000000` | Requires authorization for deposits, typically meaning that funds can only be sent to this account via specific protocol transactions rather than standard `Payment` transactions. |

**`Sequence`**

The `Sequence` number of a pseudo-account must be initialized to `0` and must not be changed. This, combined with the disabled master key, prevents the account from ever submitting a transaction on its own behalf.

**`RegularKey`**

A `RegularKey` must not be set on a pseudo-account.

###### **Reserves**

The cost of creating a pseudo-account depends on whether it is owned and controlled by another account.

* **Owned Pseudo-Accounts:** For objects like a `Vault` where a single account owns and controls the associated pseudo-account, the transaction must increase the owner's XRP reserve by one increment. This is in addition to any other reserve requirements of the transaction (e.g., for the `Vault` object itself). The transaction fee is the standard network fee.

* **Unowned Pseudo-Accounts:** For objects like an `AMM` that are not owned by any account, the creation transaction must charge a special, higher-than-normal transaction fee. This fee must be at least the value of one incremental owner reserve (currently **2 XRP**, subject to change via Fee Voting). This amount is burned, compensating for the permanent ledger space without tying the reserve to a specific owner.

###### **Deletion**

A pseudo-account must be deleted together with the associated object.

###### **Invariants**

The following invariants must hold true for any `AccountRoot` entry functioning as a pseudo-account:

* The ledger object identified by the `<Object>ID` field must exist.
* Exactly one `<Object>ID` field must be present on the `AccountRoot` (e.g., an account cannot be linked to both an `AMMID` and a `VaultID`).
* The `lsfDisableMaster` and `lsfDepositAuth` flags must always be set.
* The `Sequence` number must always be `0`, and must never change.
  * AMM pseudo-accounts created under old rules will have a sequence number set to the index of the ledger they were created in. They still must never change.
* A `RegularKey` must not be set.

### Security Considerations

The design of pseudo-accounts includes several critical security features:

* **No Direct Control:** The mandatory `lsfDisableMaster` flag and the absence of a `RegularKey` ensure that no user can directly control the pseudo-account or its assets. All fund movements are governed exclusively by the rules of the associated protocol.
* **Transaction Prevention:** A `Sequence` of `0` makes it impossible for the account to submit transactions, preventing any misuse of the account itself.
* **Address Front-running Prevention:** The deterministic but unpredictable method for generating the account address prevents attackers from guessing the address and sending funds to it before it is officially created by the protocol.
* **Controlled Deposits:** The `lsfDepositAuth` flag prevents arbitrary `Payment` transactions from being sent to the account, ensuring that its balances can only be modified through legitimate protocol transactions.
