# XLS-78: Subscriptions

## Abstract

This proposal introduces a subscription (recurring payments) mechanism to the XRP Ledger (XRPL), enabling functionality similar to direct debits. The amendment allows account owners to authorize automated recurring payments with predefined parameters such as amount, frequency, and destination, supporting XRP, Trustline-based tokens (IOUs), and Multi-Purpose Tokens (MPTs).

## Motivation

Currently, payments on the XRP Ledger require the sender to initiate and sign each transaction. While off-chain solutions like Xaman API have introduced pull payments where transactions can be generated by the destination and signed by the sender, this still requires per-transaction authorization, which is impractical for subscription services.

This proposal addresses this limitation by introducing a subscription feature that allows pre-authorized recurring payments, improving user experience and enabling a broader range of services on the XRP Ledger. The subscription model balances user convenience with security by allowing pre-authorized payments within defined parameters while maintaining user control over amounts and frequency.

## 1. Implementation

This amendment introduces new ledger objects and transactions to support recurring payments for XRP, IOUs, and MPTs, accounting for the specific behaviors and constraints associated with each token type.

## 2. Specification

### 2.1. Ledger Entries

#### 2.1.1. Subscription

##### 2.1.1.1. Object Identifier

The Subscription object ID is computed as the SHA-512Half of:

- The Subscription space key (0x0055)
- The Account ID
- The Destination ID
- The Transaction Sequence

##### 2.1.1.2. Fields

| Field Name        | Constant | Required    | Internal Type | Default Value | Description                                                                     |

##### 2.1.1.3. Ownership

The Subscription object is linked to two OwnerDirectory entries:

- The source account's OwnerDirectory (via OwnerNode) - increments owner count
- The destination account's OwnerDirectory (via DestinationNode) - does not increment owner count

Only the source account's owner count is affected because they bear the reserve requirement.

##### 2.1.1.4. Reserves

Creating a Subscription object increases the owner's XRP reserve by one increment.
This reserve is returned when the subscription is deleted.

##### 2.1.1.5. Deletion

The Subscription can be deleted through:

- `SubscriptionCancel` transaction from either the owner or destination
- `SubscriptionClaim` transaction when the expiration time is reached and the claim is successful
- Account deletion is blocked while any subscriptions exist (either as owner or destination)

##### 2.1.1.6. Freeze/Lock Compliance

For IOUs:

- **Global Freeze**: Prevents creation and claims
- **Individual Freeze**: Prevents creation and claims for frozen account
- **Deep Freeze**: Prevents all operations

For MPTs:

- **Lock Conditions**: Prevent creation and claims for locked accounts

##### 2.1.1.7. Invariants

Before and after any transaction:

- `Balance` ≤ `SendMax`
- `NextClaimTime` ≥ `StartTime` (if StartTime present)
- `Expiration` > `NextClaimTime` (if Expiration present)
- `Frequency` > 0
- `Account` ≠ `Destination`
- If non-XRP: asset must exist and be valid

##### 2.1.1.8. Example JSON

## 3. Key Differences Between Token Types in Subscriptions

| Aspect                        | XRP            | IOU Tokens                    | Multi-Purpose Tokens (MPTs)  |
| ----------------------------- | -------------- | ----------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| **Holdings**                  | Native balance | Trustline required            | MPToken object required      |
| **Authorization**             | N/A            | lsfRequireAuth flag           | tfMPTRequireAuth flag        |
| **Transfer Capability**       | Always allowed | Subject to freeze             | Requires tfMPTCanTransfer    |
| **Freeze/Lock**               | N/A            | Global/Individual/Deep freeze | Lock conditions              |
| **Transfer Costs**            | None           | TransferRate (current)        | TransferFee (current)        |
| **Auto-creation**             | N/A            | Trustline during claim        | MPToken during claim         |
| **Reserve for Auto-creation** | N/A            | Required from destination     | Required from destination    |
| **Issuer Special Cases**      | N/A            | Can be source or destination  | Doesn't hold MPToken objects |

## 4. Arrears and Balance Management

The subscription system implements a specific arrears mechanism:

1. **Period Tracking:** Each subscription tracks the current period via NextClaimTime
2. **Balance per Period:** Each period has an available Balance (≤ SendMax)
3. **Partial Claims:** Destinations can claim less than the full Balance
4. **Forfeit on Arrears:** If a period ends with unused Balance and the next period is entered:
   - The unused Balance is forfeited
   - NextClaimTime advances by exactly one Frequency
   - Balance resets to the full SendMax
5. **No Bulk Claims:** Only one period can be processed per claim transaction

This design prevents transaction spam while allowing flexible billing patterns.

## 5. Rationale

Key design decisions and their justifications:

### 5.1. Single Claim per Period

Limiting to one claim per period simplifies implementation and prevents spam. Services requiring multiple payments should use appropriate frequencies (e.g., weekly instead of monthly).

### 5.2. Balance Tracking with Forfeit

Tracking balance within periods allows partial claims while the forfeit mechanism prevents indefinite accumulation of claimable amounts.

### 5.3. No Transfer Rate Storage

Using current transfer rates/fees at claim time (rather than storing at creation) simplifies the implementation and aligns with standard XRPL token transfer behavior.

### 5.4. Dual Ownership Model

Allowing both source and destination to cancel provides flexibility for both parties while the reserve requirement remains only with the source.

### 5.5. Auto-creation of Holdings

Allowing trustlines and MPTokens to be created during claims (when authorized) improves user experience for new token recipients.

## 6. Backwards Compatibility

This amendment introduces:

- New ledger object type (Subscription)
- Three new transaction types
- No modifications to existing functionality

The amendment is fully backwards compatible. Existing transactions and ledger objects are unaffected.

## 7. Security Considerations

### 7.1. Built-in Protections

- **Amount Limits:** Claims cannot exceed authorized amounts
- **Time Restrictions:** Claims limited by frequency periods
- **Balance Tracking:** Prevents over-claiming within periods
- **Asset Type Validation:** Ensures claims match subscription asset
- **Authorization Compliance:** Respects all issuer requirements
- **Reserve Requirements:** Economic cost prevents spam

### 7.2. Potential Risks and Mitigations

**Risk:** Services claiming maximum amounts unnecessarily

- _Mitigation:_ Users can cancel at any time
- _Mitigation:_ Services risk losing customers through abuse

**Risk:** Users canceling after receiving services

- _Mitigation:_ Services enforce terms of service
- _Mitigation:_ Services can implement deposit/prepayment models

**Risk:** Timing attacks on period boundaries

- _Mitigation:_ Strict time validation in claim logic
- _Mitigation:_ Atomic period advancement

**Risk:** Griefing through subscription spam

- _Mitigation:_ Reserve requirements make spam expensive
- _Mitigation:_ Both parties can cancel unwanted subscriptions

### 7.3. Compliance Features

The system respects all existing XRPL compliance mechanisms:

- IOU freeze capabilities remain effective
- MPT lock capabilities remain effective
- Authorization requirements are enforced
- All standard AML/KYC controls apply

## 9. FAQ

**Q: Why can't I claim multiple periods at once?**
A: This prevents transaction spam and aligns with typical billing patterns. Services should set appropriate frequencies.

**Q: What happens if I don't claim for several periods?**
A: You can claim as many times as needed to advance to the current period.

**Q: Can partial amounts be claimed?**
A: Yes, useful for usage-based billing where the exact amount varies.

**Q: How do transfer rates/fees work?**
A: Current rates are applied at claim time, not stored at creation, ensuring consistency with normal XRPL transfers.

**Q: Can subscriptions be paused?**
A: Not directly, but services can claim zero amounts or users can cancel and recreate subscriptions.

**Q: What if the destination doesn't have a trustline/MPToken?**
A: If authorization isn't required and the destination has sufficient reserve, these are auto-created during the first claim.

**Q: Can I update the frequency or destination?**
A: No, these are immutable. Cancel and create a new subscription if changes are needed.
