# Directory

When a standard moves to a folder + file(s) in the Code section of this repository, it should be added to the `standards.toml` file:
https://github.com/XRPLF/XRPL-Standards/blob/master/standards.toml

# Numbering

**Suggestions/Standards** must be **numbered** and referenced in the following format: XLS-# where # is a natural number (without left padded zeros), called the __Suggestion/Standard Number__.

# Revisions

If a suggestion/standard requires a substantive revision and using the same number would result in confusion, a separator '.' may be added, e.g. `XLS-1.1`.

# Drafts

A suggestion/standard may be marked as a draft e.g. `XLS-10d` or `XLS-1.2d` if the author/s expect further revisions in the near term. After sufficient time without change the suggestion/standard can be referred to without the draft indicator.
