# XRP Ledger Standards

XRP Ledger Standards (XLSs) describe standards and specifications relating to the XRP Ledger ecosystem that help achieve the following goals:

* Ensure interoperability and compatibility between XRPL applications, tools, and platforms.
* Maintain a continued, excellent user experience around every application or system.
* Drive alignment and agreement in the XRPL community (i.e., developers, users, operators, etc).

# Spec Identification
In order to distinguish one specification from another, and to provide for updates and enhancemnets, the following document identification scheme must be used:

## Numbering

Standards must be numbered and referenced in the following format: `XLS-{#}` where `{#}` is a natural number (without left padded zeros), called the __Standard Number__.

## Revisions

If a standard requires a substantive revision a separator `.` _should_ be added to indicate a change, e.g. `XLS-1.1`.

## Drafts

A standard which has not yet been adopted may hold a Standard Number but must be referred to with a `d` suffix until it becomes a full standard. For example, `XLS-10d` or `XLS-1.2d`.

## Indexing

When a standard moves to a folder in this repository, an entry should should be added to the `standards.toml` file to provide metadata for the specification:
