# Single Asset Vault

## _Abstract_

A Single Asset Vault is a new on-chain primitive for aggregating assets from one or more depositors, and making the assets available for other on-chain protocols. The Single Asset Vault uses [Multi-Purpose-Token](https://github.com/XRPLF/XRPL-Standards/tree/master/XLS-0033d-multi-purpose-tokens) to represent ownership shares of the Vault. The Vault serves diverse purposes, such as lending markets, aggregators, yield-bearing tokens, asset management, etc. The Single Asset Vault decouples the liquidity provision functionality from the specific protocol logic.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Overview

The **Single Asset Vault** is an on-chain object that aggregates assets from one or more depositors and represents ownership through shares. Other protocols, such as the [Lending Protocol](https://github.com/XRPLF/XRPL-Standards/discussions/190), can access these assets via the vault, whether or not they generate yield. Currently, other protocols must be created by the same Account that created the Vault. However, this may change in the future.

The specification introduces a new `Vault` ledger entry, which contains key details such as available assets, shares, total value, and other relevant information.

The specification includes the following transactions:

**Vault Management**:

- **`VaultCreate`**: Creates a new Vault object.
- **`VaultSet`**: Updates an existing Vault object.
- **`VaultDelete`**: Deletes an existing Vault object.

**Asset Management**:

- **`VaultDeposit`**: Deposits a specified number of assets into the Vault in exchange for shares.
- **`VaultWithdraw`**: Withdraws a specified number of assets from the Vault in exchange for shares.

Additionally, an issuer can perform a **Clawback** operation:

- **`VaultClawback`**: Allows the issuer of an IOU or MPT to claw back funds from the vault, as outlined in the [Clawback documentation](https://xrpl.org/docs/use-cases/tokenization/stablecoin-issuer#clawback).

#### 1.1.1 Vault Ownership and Management

A Single Asset Vault is owned and managed by an account called the **Vault Owner**. The account is reponsible for creating, updating and deleting the Vault object.

#### 1.1.2 Access Control

A Single Asset Vault can be either public or private. Any depositor can deposit and redeem liquidity from a public vault, provided they own sufficient shares. In contrast, access to private shares is controlled via [Permissioned Domains](https://github.com/XRPLF/XRPL-Standards/discussions/228), which use on-chain [Credentials](https://github.com/XRPLF/XRPL-Standards/tree/master/XLS-0070d-credentials) to manage access to the vault. Only depositors with the necessary credentials can deposit assets to a private vault. To prevent Vault Owner from locking away depositor funds, any shareholder can withdraw funds. Furthermore, the Vault Owner has an implicit permission to deposit and withdraw assets to and from the Vault. I.e. they do not have to have credentials in the Permissioned Domain.

#### 1.1.3 Yield Bearing Shares

Shares represent the ownership of a portion of the vault's assets. On-chain shares are represented by a [Multi-Purpose Token](https://github.com/XRPLF/XRPL-Standards/tree/master/XLS-0033d-multi-purpose-tokens). When creating the vault, the Vault Owner can configure the shares to be non-transferable. Non-transferable shares cannot be transferred to any other account -- they can only be redeemed. If the vault is private, shares can be transferred and used in other DeFi protocols as long as the receiving account is authorized to hold the shares. The vault's shares may be yield-bearing, depending on the protocol connected to the vault, meaning that a holder may be able to withdraw more (or less) liquidity than they initially deposited.

### 1.2 Terminology

- **Vault**: A ledger entry for aggregating liquidity and providing this liquidity to one or more accessors.
- **Asset**: The currency of a vault. It is either XRP, a [Fungible Token](https://xrpl.org/docs/concepts/tokens/fungible-tokens/) or a [Multi-Purpose Token](https://github.com/XRPLF/XRPL-Standards/tree/master/XLS-0033d-multi-purpose-tokens).
- **Share**: Shares represent the depositors' portion of the vault's assets. Shares are a [Multi-Purpose Token](https://github.com/XRPLF/XRPL-Standards/tree/master/XLS-0033d-multi-purpose-tokens) created by the _pseudo-account_ of the vault.

### 1.3 Actors

- **Vault Owner**: An account responsible for creating and deleting The Vault.
- **Depositor**: An entity that deposits and withdraws assets to and from the vault.

### 1.4 Connecting to the Vault

A protocol connecting to a Vault must track its debt. Furthermore, the updates to the Vault state when funds are removed or added back must be handled in the transactors of the protocol. For an example, please refer to the [Lending Protocol](https://github.com/XRPLF/XRPL-Standards/discussions/190) specification.

## 2. Ledger Entries

### 2.1 `Vault` Ledger Entry

The **`Vault`** ledger entry describes the state of the tokenized vault.

#### 2.1.1 Object Identifier

The key of the `Vault` object is the result of [`SHA512-Half`](https://xrpl.org/docs/references/protocol/data-types/basic-data-types/#hashes) of the following values concatenated in order:

- The `Vault` space key `0x0056` (capital V)
- The `AccountID`(https://xrpl.org/docs/references/protocol/binary-format/#accountid-fields) of the account submitting the `VaultSet`transaction, i.e.`VaultOwner`.
- The transaction `Sequence` number. If the transaction used a [Ticket](https://xrpl.org/docs/concepts/accounts/tickets/), use the `TicketSequence` value.

#### 2.1.2 Fields

A vault has the following fields:

##### 2.1.2.1 Flags

The `Vault` object supports the following flags:

| Flag Name         | Flag Value | Modifiable? |                 Description                  |
| ----------------- | :--------: | :---------: | :------------------------------------------: |
| `lsfVaultPrivate` |  `0x0001`  |    `No`     | If set, indicates that the vault is private. |

#### 2.1.3 Vault `_pseudo-account_`

An AccountRoot entry holds the XRP, IOU or MPT deposited into the vault. It also acts as the issuer of the vault's shares. The _pseudo-account_ follows the XLS-64d specification for pseudo accounts. The `AccountRoot` object is created when creating the `Vault` object.

#### 2.1.4 Ownership

The `Vault` objects are stored in the ledger and tracked in an [Owner Directory](https://xrpl.org/docs/references/protocol/ledger-data/ledger-entry-types/directorynode) owned by the account submitting the `VaultSet` transaction. Furthermore, to facilitate `Vault` object lookup from the vault shares, the object is also tracked in the `OwnerDirectory` of the _`pseudo-account`_.

#### 2.1.5 Owner Reserve

The `Vault` object costs one reserve fee per object created:

- The `Vault` object itself.
- The `MPTokenIssuance` associated with the shares of the Vault.

#### 2.1.6 Vault Shares

Shares represent the portion of the Vault assets a depositor owns. Vault Owners set the currency code of the share and whether the token is transferable during the vault's creation. These two values are immutable. The share is represented by a [Multi-Purpose Token](https://github.com/XRPLF/XRPL-Standards/tree/master/XLS-0033d-multi-purpose-tokens). The MPT is issued by the vault's pseudo-account.

##### 2.1.6.1 `MPTokenIssuance`

The `MPTokenIssuance` object represents the share on the ledger. It is created and deleted together with the `Vault` object.

###### 2.1.6.1.1 `MPTokenIssuance` Values

Here’s the table with the headings "Field," "Description," and "Value":

| **Field**         | **Description**                                        | **Value**            |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------- |
| `Issuer`          | The AccountID of the Vault's _pseudo-account_.         | _pseudo-account_ ID  |
| `MaximumAmount`   | No limit to the number of shares that can be issued.   | `0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF` |
| `TransferFee`     | The fee paid to transfer the shares.                   | 0                    |
| `MPTokenMetadata` | Arbitrary metadata about the share MPT, in hex format. | -                    |

**Flags**

The following flags are set based on whether the shares are transferable and if the vault is public or private.
| **Condition** | **Transferable** | **Non-Transferable** |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| **Public Vault** | `lsfMPTCanEscrow` <br> `lsfMPTCanTrade`<br> `lsfMPTCanTransfer` | No Flags |
| **Private Vault** | `lsfMPTCanEscrow`<br> `lsfMPTCanTrade`<br> `lsfMPTCanTransfer`<br> `lsfMPTRequireAuth` | `lsfMPTRequireAuth` |

##### 2.1.6.2 `MPToken`

The `MPToken` object represents the amount of shares held by a depositor. It is created when the account deposits liquidity into the vault and is deleted when a depositor redeems (or transfers) all shares.

###### 2.1.6.2.1 `MPToken` Values

The `MPToken` values should be set as per the `MPT` [specification](https://github.com/XRPLF/XRPL-Standards/tree/master/XLS-0033d-multi-purpose-tokens#2122-fields).

| **Condition**     | **Transferable**   | **Non-Transferable** |
| ----------------- | ------------------ | -------------------- |
| **Public Vault**  | No Flags           | `lsfMPTAuthorized`   |
| **Private Vault** | `lsfMPTAuthorized` | `lsfMPTAuthorized`   |

#### 2.1.7 Exchange Algorithm

Exchange Algorithm refers to the logic that is used to exchange assets into shares and shares into assets. This logic is executed when depositing or redeeming liquidity. A Vault comes with the default exchange algorithm, which is detailed below.

##### 2.1.7.1 Unrealized Loss

A well-informed depositor may learn of an incoming loss and redeem their shares early, causing the remaining depositors to bear the full loss. To discourage such behaviour, we introduce a concept of "paper loss," captured by the `Vault` object's `LossUnrealized` attribute. The "paper loss" captures a potential loss the vault may experience and thus temporarily decreases the vault value. Only a protocol connected to the `Vault` may increase or decrease the `LossUnrealized` attribute.

The "paper loss" temporarily decreases the vault value. A malicious depositor may take advantage of this to deposit assets at a lowered price and withdraw them once the price increases.

Consider a vault with a total value of $1.0m and total shares of $1.0m. Assume the "paper loss" for the vault is $900k. The new exchange rate is as follows:

$$
exchangeRate = \frac{AssetTotal - LossUnrealized}{ShareTotal}
$$

$$
exchangeRate = \frac{1,000,000 - 900,000}{1,000,000} = 0.1
$$

After the "paper loss" is cleared, the new effective exchange rate would be as follows:

$$
exchangeRate = \frac{AssetTotal}{ShareTotal}
$$

$$
exchangeRate = \frac{1,000,000}{1,000,000} = 1.0
$$

A depositor could deposit $100k assets at a 0.1 exchange rate and get 1.0m shares. Once the "paper loss" is cleared, their shares would be worth $1.0m.

To account for this problem, the Vault must use two different exchange rate models: one for depositing assets and one for withdrawing them.

##### 2.1.7.2 Exchange Rate Algorithms

**Variables**

The following variables define the Vault balance:

- $\Gamma_{share}$ - the total number of shares issued by the vault.
- $\Gamma_{asset}$ - the total assets in the vault, including any future yield.

- $\Delta_{asset}$ - the change in the total amount of assets after a deposit, withdrawal, or redemption.
- $\Delta_{share}$ - che change in the total amount of shares after a deposit, withdrawal, or redemption.

- $\iota$ - the unrealized loss of the vault.

###### 2.1.7.2.1 **Deposit**

We compute the number of shares ($\Delta_{share}$) a depositor will receive as follows:

$$\Delta_{share} = \Delta_{asset} \times \frac{\Gamma_{share}}{\Gamma_{asset} + 0^{\Gamma_{asset}}} $$

The following equations govern the updated vault composition after a successful deposit:

- $\Gamma_{asset} = \Gamma_{asset} + \Delta_{asset}$ New balance of assets in the vault.
- $\Gamma_{share} = \Gamma_{share} + \Delta_{share}$ New share balance in the vault.

###### 2.1.7.2.2 **Redeem**

We compute the number of assets ($\Delta_{asset}$) returned by burning $\Delta_{share}$ as follows:

$$\Delta_{asset} = \Delta_{share} \times \frac{\Gamma_{asset} - \iota}{\Gamma_{share} + 0^{\Gamma_{share}}} $$

The following equations govern the updated vault composition after a successful redemption:

- $\Gamma_{asset} = \Gamma_{asset} - \Delta_{asset}$ New balance of assets in the vault.
- $\Gamma_{share} = \Gamma_{share} - \Delta_{share}$ New share balance in the vault.

###### 2.1.7.2.3 **Withdraw**

We compute the number of shares to burn to withdraw $\Delta_{asset}$ as follows:

$$\Delta_{share} = \Delta_{asset} \times \frac{\Gamma_{share}}{\Gamma_{asset} - \iota + 0^{\Gamma_{asset}}} $$

The following equations govern the updated vault composition after a successful withdrawal:

- $\Gamma_{asset} = \Gamma_{asset} - \Delta_{asset}$ New balance of assets in the vault.
- $\Gamma_{share} = \Gamma_{share} - \Delta_{share}$ New share balance in the vault.

##### 2.1.7.3 Withdrawal Policy

Withdrawal policy controls the logic used when removing liquidity from a vault. Each strategy has its own implementation, but it can be used in multiple vaults once implemented. Therefore, different vaults may have different withdrawal policies. The specification introduces the following options:

###### 2.1.7.3.1 `first-come-first-serve`

The First Come, First Serve strategy treats all requests equally, allowing a depositor to redeem any amount of assets provided they have a sufficient number of shares.

#### 2.1.8 Frozen Assets

The issuer of the Vaults asset may enact a freeze either through a [Global Freeze](https://xrpl.org/docs/concepts/tokens/fungible-tokens/freezes/#global-freeze) for IOUs or [locking MPT](https://github.com/XRPLF/XRPL-Standards/tree/master/XLS-0033d-multi-purpose-tokens#21122-flags). When the vaults asset is frozen, it can only be withdrawn by specifying the `Destination` account as the `Issuer` of the asset. Similarly, a frozen asset _may not_ be deposited into a vault. Furthermore, when the asset of a vault is frozen, the shares corresponding to the asset may not be transferred.

#### 2.1.9 Transfer Fees

The Vault does not apply the [Transfer Fee](https://xrpl.org/docs/concepts/tokens/transfer-fees) to `VaultDeposit` and `VaultWithdraw` transactions. Furthermore, whenever a protocol moves assets from or to a Vault, the `Transfer Fee` must not be charged.

## 3. Transactions

All transactions introduced by this proposal incorporate the [common transaction fields](https://xrpl.org/docs/references/protocol/transactions/common-fields) that are shared by all transactions. Standard fields are only documented in this proposal if needed because this proposal introduces new possible values for such fields.

### 3.1 `VaultCreate`, `VaultSet`, `VaultDelete` transactions

The `Vault` object is managed with `VaultCreate`, `VaultSet` and `VaultDelete` transactions.

#### 3.1.1 `VaultCreate` Transaction

The `VaultCreate` transaction creates a new `Vault` object.

| Field Name         |     Required?      |     JSON Type      | Internal Type |      Default Value       | Description                                                                     |

- Create a new `MPTokenIssuance` ledger object for the vault shares.
  - If the `DomainID` is provided:
    - `MPTokenIssuance(Vault.MPTokenIssuanceID).DomainID = DomainID` (Set the Permissioned Domain ID).
- Create a new `AccountRoot`[_pseudo-account_](https://github.com/XRPLF/XRPL-Standards/discussions/191) object setting the `PseudoOwner` to `VaultID`.

- If `Vault.Asset` is an `IOU`:

  - Create a `RippleState` object between the _pseudo-account_ `AccountRoot` and `Issuer` `AccountRoot`.

## A-1 F.A.Q.

### A-1.1 Why does the specification allow both `Withdraw` and `Redeem` and not just one of them?

We chose this design in order to reduce the amount of off-chain math required to be implemented by XRPL users and/or developers

### A-1.2 Why can any account that holds Vaults shares submit a `VaultWithdraw` transaction?

The `VaultWithdraw` transaction does not respect the permissioned domain rules. In other words, any account that holds the shares of the Vault can withdraw them.

The decision was made to avoid a situation where a depositor deposits assets to a private vault to then have their access revoked by invalidating their credentials, and thus loosing access to their funds.

### A-1.3 How can a depositor transfer shares to another account?

Vault shares are a first-class assets, meaning that they can be transfered and used in other on-ledger protocols that support MPTokens. However, the payee (or the receiver) of the shares must have permissions to hold the shares and the assset that the shares represent. For example, if the shares are for a private Vault containing `USDC` the destination account must be in the permissioned domain of the Vault, and have permissions to hold `USDC`.

In addion, any compliance mechanisms applied to `USDC` will also apply to the share. For example, if the Issuer of `USDC` freezes the Trustline of the payee, then the payee will not be able to receive any shares representing `USDC`.

### A-1.4 What is the difference between the `VaultOwner` and the `pseudo-account`?

XRP Ledger is an account based blockchain. That means that assets (XRP, IOU and MPT must be held by an account). The Vault Object (or any other object, such as the AMM) cannot hold assets directly. Therefore, a pseudo-account is created that holds the assets on behalf of that object. The pseudo-account is a stand-alone account, that cannot receive funds, it cannot send transactions, it is there to only hold assets. So for example, when a depositor deposits assets into a vault, in reality this transaction moves the assets from the depositor account to the pseudo-account.
