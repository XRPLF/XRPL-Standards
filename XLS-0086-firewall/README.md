## 1. Abstract

This amendment introduces a comprehensive Firewall framework for the XRP Ledger, providing destination-based security through whitelisted recipients (WithdrawPreauth) with counterparty authorization. The system provides multi-layered protection through:

1. A whitelist that restricts outgoing payments to pre-approved recipients
2. A counterparty authorization system that adds an additional security layer, preventing single points of failure in account security
3. A transaction classification system that determines which transactions are subject to firewall checks
4. Fee drain protection that prevents account draining through excessive transaction fees

## 2. Motivation

The XRPL protocol currently lacks native mechanisms to prevent compromised accounts from being instantly drained. While multi-signature functionality exists, its complexity and limited wallet support have prevented widespread adoption.

Current security options are insufficient:

- Single-key accounts provide no protection against key compromise
- Multisig requires complex coordination and lacks widespread wallet support
- No native mechanism exists to restrict outgoing payments to trusted addresses
- Zero protection against malicious account draining
- No defense against fee-based drain attacks

This amendment addresses these gaps by providing:

- Simple whitelist-based protection accessible to all users
- Dual-control security without multisig complexity
- Protection against unauthorized withdrawal
- Transaction-level control over which operations require authorization
- Fee drain protection through maximum fee limits

## 3. Introduction

The Firewall system introduces a new security paradigm for the XRP Ledger based on destination whitelisting and fee protection. Once enabled, an account can only send value to pre-authorized recipients for transactions that are subject to firewall checks, and all transactions are subject to maximum fee limits.

### 3.1. Terminology

**Core Components:**

- **Firewall**: A ledger object that enables destination-based restrictions and fee limits on an account
- **Counterparty**: A trusted account that must co-sign changes to firewall settings
- **Backup**: A mandatory preauthorized account where assets can be sent without restriction, in the event of key compromise
- **MaxFee**: Optional maximum transaction fee limit to prevent fee-based drain attacks

**WithdrawPreauth Features:**

- **WithdrawPreauth**: Authorization for a specific account to receive assets from a firewall protected account
- **DestinationTag**: Optional tag that can be required for preauthorized transfers

**Transaction Control:**

- **FirewallAction**: Classification of how each transaction type interacts with the firewall (allow, check, or block)

### 3.2. Summary

**Ledger Objects:**

- `Firewall`: Stores the counterparty relationship, security configuration, and fee limits
- `WithdrawPreauth`: Represents authorization for specific recipients with optional destination tag

**Transactions:**

- `FirewallSet`: Creates or Updates a firewall configuration including fee limits (update requires counterparty approval)
- `FirewallDelete`: Removes a firewall (requires counterparty approval)
- `WithdrawPreauth`: Adds or removes authorized recipients with optional destination tags (requires counterparty approval)

## 4. Specification

### 4.1. Ledger Entries

#### 4.1.1. Firewall

##### 4.1.1.1. Object Identifier

**Key Space**: `0x0046` (hex representation)

### 4.3. Firewall Check Implementation

The firewall system integrates into the transaction processing pipeline through a preclaim check that validates transactions against the firewall configuration before they are applied.

#### 4.3.1. Architecture

The firewall check is implemented in the `Transactor::checkFirewall` method which is called during the preclaim phase of transaction processing.

#### 4.3.2. Check Flow

```cpp
NotTEC
Transactor::checkFirewall(PreclaimContext const& ctx)
{
    // Get the account (handle delegation)
    auto const account = ctx.tx.isFieldPresent(sfDelegate)
        ? ctx.tx.getAccountID(sfDelegate)
        : ctx.tx.getAccountID(sfAccount);

    // Check if firewall exists
    auto const sleFirewall = ctx.view.read(keylet::firewall(account));
    if (!sleFirewall)
        return tesSUCCESS;  // No firewall, proceed normally

    // Check fee limit if MaxFee is set (most efficient check first)
    if (sleFirewall.isFieldPresent(sfMaxFee) &&
        ctx.tx.getFieldAmount(sfFee) > sleFirewall.getFieldAmount(sfMaxFee))
        return tefFIREWALL_BLOCK;  // Fee exceeds maximum allowed

    // Check transaction classification
    auto const txType = ctx.tx.getFieldU16(sfTransactionType);

    if (Firewall::getInstance().isAllowed(txType))
        return tesSUCCESS;  // Transaction type is allowed

    if (Firewall::getInstance().isBlocked(txType))
        return tefFIREWALL_BLOCK;  // Transaction type is blocked

    // Transaction requires check
    // Special handling for Payment transactions
    if (ctx.tx.getTxnType() == ttPAYMENT)
    {
        // Block self-payments and payments with paths
        if (ctx.tx.getAccountID(sfDestination) == account ||
            ctx.tx.isFieldPresent(sfPaths))
            return tefFIREWALL_BLOCK;
    }

    // Verify destination is present
    if (!ctx.tx.isFieldPresent(sfDestination))
        return tefFIREWALL_BLOCK;

    // Check WithdrawPreauth
    auto const destination = ctx.tx.getAccountID(sfDestination);
    auto const destinationTag = ctx.tx.isFieldPresent(sfDestinationTag)
        ? ctx.tx.getFieldU32(sfDestinationTag)
        : 0;

    if (!ctx.view.exists(keylet::withdrawPreauth(account, destination, destinationTag)))
        return tefFIREWALL_BLOCK;

    return tesSUCCESS;
}
```

#### 4.3.3. Integration Points

The `checkFirewall` function is called in the transaction processing pipeline:

1. After signature validation (`checkSign`)
2. Before the transaction-specific preclaim checks
3. Returns `tefFIREWALL_BLOCK` if the transaction violates firewall rules or exceeds fee limits

### 4.4. Transaction Firewall Actions

Each transaction type is classified with a `FirewallAction` enum value that determines how it interacts with the firewall system:

```cpp
enum FirewallAction { check, allow, block };
```

The classification is embedded in the transaction definition macro system:

| Transaction Type            | FirewallAction | Rationale                                          |

## 5. Rationale

**Simplified Architecture**: The removal of the complex rule system and post-application checking in favor of preclaim validation significantly reduces implementation complexity while maintaining security guarantees. The invariant-style checker pattern was eliminated because:

- Preclaim checking is more efficient
- Simpler to reason about and audit
- Prevents wasted computation on invalid transactions

**Fee Drain Protection**: The MaxFee field provides critical protection against fee-based drain attacks where a compromised key could execute many high-fee transactions to drain an account. This feature:

- Prevents rapid draining through excessive fees
- Is configurable based on user needs
- Requires counterparty approval to change
- Applies uniformly to all transactions
- Is checked first for maximum efficiency

**Transaction Classification**: The three-tier classification system (allow/check/block) provides clear semantics for how each transaction type interacts with the firewall:

- **allow**: Transaction poses no risk of unauthorized value transfer
- **check**: Transaction may transfer value and requires destination validation
- **block**: Transaction involves complex operations that could bypass simple checks

**Preclaim Validation**: Checking firewall constraints during the preclaim phase:

- Prevents invalid transactions from consuming computational resources
- Provides clear, early feedback on transaction validity
- Integrates cleanly with existing validation pipeline

**Whitelist Model**: Chosen over blacklist as it's more secure by default - new threats are automatically blocked rather than requiring updates to block them.

**Counterparty System**: Provides a second layer of security for firewall changes, preventing single points of failure. Even with master key compromise, an attacker cannot disable protections.

**Enforced Backup Account**: Ensures users cannot lock themselves out during initial setup, addressing common security configuration errors.

**Destination Tag Support**: Allows fine-grained control over authorized destinations, supporting exchange accounts and service providers that require specific tags.

**Path Payment Blocking**: Payments with paths are blocked because path-finding could route through intermediate accounts, making destination validation complex and potentially bypassable.

**Self-Payment Blocking**: Self-payments are blocked to prevent potential bypass scenarios and maintain consistent security semantics.

**AMM and Cross-Chain Blocking**: These complex multi-party operations are blocked entirely rather than attempting partial validation that could miss edge cases.

## 6. Backwards Compatibility

This amendment introduces no backwards incompatibilities:

- Accounts without firewalls continue operating normally
- All existing transaction types remain functional
- The feature is entirely opt-in
- No changes to existing ledger entries or transaction formats
- Existing destination tag functionality is preserved and enhanced
- Delegated transactions are properly handled
- Fee limits are optional and do not affect accounts without firewalls

## 7. Security Considerations

### 7.1. Key Compromise Protection

Even with full key compromise, attackers cannot:

- Send assets to unauthorized addresses
- Disable the firewall without counterparty approval
- Add or remove existing preauthorizations without counterparty approval
- Exceed the maximum fee limit set on the firewall
- Disable master key while firewall is active
- Set a new regular key or signers list without counterparty approval
- Bypass destination tag requirements
- Use complex transactions (AMM, cross-chain) to bypass restrictions
- Drain the account through excessive transaction fees

Attackers can only:

- Send assets to already-authorized addresses with matching tags
- Perform allowed account management operations within fee limits
- Cancel existing obligations
- Submit transactions with fees up to the MaxFee limit

### 7.2. Counterparty Risk

A compromised counterparty cannot change anything alone. Both master key and counterparty signatures are required for:

- Adding/removing preauthorizations
- Changing counterparty
- Modifying fee limits
- Deleting firewall

Mitigation: Choose counterparty carefully, consider using a second account you control with separated key hygiene.

### 7.3. Denial of Service

A malicious counterparty cannot:

- Prevent transfers to already-authorized addresses
- Lock the account permanently
- Delete the firewall unilaterally
- Change firewall settings unilaterally
- Modify destination tag requirements without authorization
- Change fee limits without authorization

The worst a malicious counterparty can do is refuse to sign legitimate changes, preventing new authorizations or fee limit adjustments.

### 7.4. Transaction Type Coverage

The transaction classification system ensures:

- Value-transferring transactions are appropriately restricted
- Account management operations remain available
- Complex transactions that could bypass simple checks are blocked
- Cancellation and cleanup operations are generally allowed
- Issuer rights (clawback) cannot be blocked
- All transactions respect fee limits when set

### 7.5. Fee Drain Attack Prevention

The MaxFee protection prevents several attack vectors:

**Attack Scenarios Prevented:**

1. **Rapid small-fee drain**: Attacker submits thousands of minimum-value transactions with maximum fees
2. **Network congestion exploit**: Attacker uses high fees during network congestion to accelerate draining
3. **Failed transaction drain**: Attacker submits deliberately failing transactions with high fees
4. **Batch fee attacks**: Multiple high-fee transactions submitted simultaneously

**Protection Characteristics:**

- Fee limit applies to ALL transactions from the protected account
- Cannot be bypassed even with valid destinations
- Cannot be changed without counterparty approval
- Provides predictable maximum loss rate
- Checked before any other validation for efficiency

**Recommended Settings:**

- Regular users: 10,000-100,000 drops (0.01-0.1 XRP)
- High-volume users: 1,000,000 drops (1 XRP)
- Payment processors: 5,000,000 drops (5 XRP)
- During network congestion: Temporary increase with counterparty approval

### 7.6. Implementation Security

- Preclaim checking prevents resource exhaustion attacks
- Clear error codes (`tefFIREWALL_BLOCK`) for debugging
- No complex state tracking or accumulation
- Deterministic validation across all validators
- No external dependencies or oracle requirements
- Fee checks occur first to minimize computation on invalid transactions

## 8. Appendix

### 8.1. FAQ

**Q: Can incoming payments be blocked?**
A: No, this system only restricts outgoing payments. Incoming payments are always allowed.

**Q: What if my counterparty becomes unavailable?**
A: Existing preauthorized addresses continue working. You cannot add new ones or change fee limits without counterparty cooperation.

**Q: Can I remove the firewall?**
A: Yes, with counterparty approval using FirewallDelete transaction. All WithdrawPreauth entries are automatically removed.

**Q: How many addresses can I preauthorize?**
A: Limited only by reserve requirements and directory size limits.

**Q: Can I use destination tags with the firewall?**
A: Yes, WithdrawPreauth entries can specify required destination tags, providing fine-grained control over authorized destinations.

**Q: What happens if network fees exceed my MaxFee limit?**
A: All transactions will be blocked until you increase the limit with counterparty approval. Plan for network congestion by setting reasonable buffers.

**Q: Can I remove the fee limit after setting it?**
A: Yes, set MaxFee to 0 or omit it in an update transaction (requires counterparty signature).

**Q: What's a reasonable MaxFee setting?**
A: For most users, 100,000 drops (0.1 XRP) provides good protection while allowing for moderate network congestion. High-volume users may need 1,000,000 drops (1 XRP).

**Q: Does MaxFee affect incoming transactions?**
A: No, it only limits fees on outgoing transactions from your account.

**Q: Can different transaction types have different fee limits?**
A: No, MaxFee applies uniformly to all transactions. For granular control, use separate accounts.

**Q: Why are AMM operations blocked?**
A: AMM operations involve complex multi-party trading that could potentially bypass simple destination checks. They are blocked entirely for security.

**Q: Can complex DEX trades bypass the firewall?**
A: No, OfferCreate is blocked entirely to prevent any DEX trading that could result in unauthorized asset transfers.

**Q: Can I use my own account as counterparty?**
A: Yes, but it must be a different account than the one being protected. This provides security through key separation.

**Q: What happens to existing Escrows or Payment Channels?**
A: Existing obligations created before firewall activation continue to function. The firewall only affects new transactions.

**Q: Why are path payments blocked?**
A: Path payments can route through multiple intermediate accounts, making destination validation complex and potentially bypassable.

**Q: Can I pay myself with a firewall enabled?**
A: No, self-payments are blocked to maintain consistent security semantics and prevent potential bypass scenarios.

**Q: What's the difference between check, allow, and block?**
A:

- **allow**: Transaction proceeds without firewall checks
- **check**: Transaction must have an authorized destination
- **block**: Transaction is always rejected if firewall is active

**Q: Are batch transactions affected?**
A: The Batch transaction itself is allowed, but each inner transaction is evaluated according to its own FirewallAction classification.

**Q: Can I still use regular keys with a firewall?**
A: Yes, but changes to regular keys require counterparty approval once a firewall is active.

**Q: What if my counterparty is unavailable during network congestion?**
A: You cannot increase the fee limit without counterparty approval. This is by design - security over convenience. Maintain appropriate buffers.

**Q: Are reserve fees affected by MaxFee?**
A: No, MaxFee only applies to transaction fees, not reserve requirements.

**Q: Can I set MaxFee without setting up full firewall protection?**
A: No, MaxFee is part of the Firewall object. You must enable the full firewall system.
