## Introduction

**_Remit_** is a new payment transactor designed for XRPL Protocol Chains, which allows a sender to send multiple currencies and tokens atomically to a specified destination. It is a push payment that delivers "no matter what" and is designed for retail and Hooks use-cases.

## Constraints

Using _Remit_ the sender may send:

- one or more Issued Currencies, and/or,
- one or more pre-existing URITokens owned by the sender and/or,
- one new URIToken created in-line as part of the transaction.

The transactor has the following behaviours:

- If the destination does not exist, the sender pays to create it.
- If the destination does not have the required trust-lines, the sender pays to create these.
- The exact amounts and tokens are always delivered as specified in the transaction, if validated with code tesSUCCESS.
- The sender pays all transfer fees on currencies, and the fees are not subtracted from the sent amount.
- Where the sender pays to create objects, this is a separate amount not taken from the amounts specified in the transaction.
- The transaction is atomic, either all amounts and tokens are delivered in the exact specified amount or none of them are.
- The transactor does no conversion or pathing, the sender must already have the balances and tokens they wish to send.
- When no amounts or tokens are specified, the transaction may still succeed. This can be used to create an account or ensure an account already exists.

## Specification

A _Remit_ transaction contains the following fields:
Field | Required | Type | Description
-|-|-|-
sfAccount | ✅ |AccountID | The sender
sfDestination | ✅ |AccountID | The recipient. Does not need to exist. Will be created if doesn't exist.
sfDestinationTag | ❌ |UInt32 | May be used by the destination to differentiate sub-accounts.
sfAmounts | ❌|Array of Amounts | Each of the currencies (if any) to send to the destination. Sender must have funded trustlines for each. Destination does not need trustlines.
sfURITokenIDs | ❌| Array of URITokenIDs | Each of the URITokens (if any) to send to the destination.
sfMintURIToken | ❌| URIToken | If included, an inline URIToken to be created and delivered to the destination, for example a receipt.
sfBlob | ❌ | Blob | A hex blob up to 128 kib to supply to a receiving Hook at the destination.
sfInform | ❌ | AccountID | A third party. If supplied, their Hooks will be weakly executed (but the sender will pay for that execution).
sfInvoiceID | ❌ | UInt256 | An arbitrary identifier for this remittance.

      "MintURIToken" : {
         "URI" : "68747470733A2F2F736F6D652E757269"
      }
}
```

## Unwanted Remits

Users who do not want to receive _Remit_ transactions can either set the _asfDisallowIncomingRemit_ on their accounts or install a Hook that will regulate incoming Remits. Alternatively they can simply burn unwanted URITokens or return unwanted Issued Currencies in order to claim the reserve that was paid by the sender.

## Chain Requirements

XLS-55 depends on the adoption of XLS-35 on the applicable chain.
