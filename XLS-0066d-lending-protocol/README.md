## _Abstract_

Decentralized Finance (DeFi) lending represents a transformative force within the blockchain ecosystem. It revolutionizes traditional financial services by offering a peer-to-peer alternative without intermediaries like banks or financial institutions. At its core, DeFi lending platforms empower users to borrow and lend digital assets directly, fostering financial inclusion, transparency, and efficiency.

This proposal introduces fundamental primitives for an XRP Ledger-native Lending Protocol. The protocol offers straightforward on-chain uncollateralized fixed-term loans, utilizing pooled funds with pre-set terms for interest-accruing loans. The design relies on off-chain underwriting and risk management to assess the creditworthiness of the borrowers. However, the First-Loss Capital protection scheme absorbs some of the losses in case of a Loan Default.

This version intentionally skips the complex mechanisms of automated on-chain collateral and liquidation management. Instead, it focuses on the primitives and the essential components for on-chain credit origination. Therefore, the primary design principle is flexibility and reusability to enable the introduction of additional complex features in the future.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Overview

The Lending Protocol uses the [Vault](https://github.com/XRPLF/XRPL-Standards/discussions/192) on-chain object to provision assets from one or more depositors. A Loan Broker is responsible for managing the Lending Protocol and the associated Vault. The Vault Owner and Loan Broker must be on the same account, but this may change in the future.

The specification introduces two new ledger entries: `LoanBroker` and `Loan`. The `LoanBroker` object captures the Lending Protocol-specific details, such as fees and First-Loss Capital cover. Furthermore, it tracks the funds taken from the `Vault`. The `Loan` object captures the Loan agreement between the Loan Broker and the Borrower.

The specification introduces the following transactions:

- **`LoanBrokerSet`**: A transaction to create a new `LoanBroker` object.
- **`LoanBrokerDelete`**: A transaction to delete an existing `LoanBroker` object.
- **`LoanBrokerCoverDeposit`**: A transaction to deposit First-Loss Capital.
- **`LoanBrokerCoverWithdraw`**: A transaction to withdraw First-Loss Capital.
- **`LoanBrokerCoverClawback`**: A transaction to clawback the First-Loss Capital. This transaction can only be submitted by the Issuer of the asset.
- **`LoanSet`**: A transaction to create a new `Loan` object.
- **`LoanDelete`**: A transaction to delete an existing `Loan` object.
- **`LoanManage`**: A transaction to manage an existing `Loan`.
- **`LoanPay`**: A transaction to make a `Loan` payment.

The flow of the lending protocol is as follows:

1. The Loan Broker creates a `Vault` ledger entry.
2. The Loan Broker creates a `LoanBroker` ledger entry with a `LoanBrokerSet` transaction.
3. The Depositors deposit assets into the `Vault`.
4. Optionally, the Loan Broker deposits First-Loss Capital into the `LoanBroker` with the `LoanBrokerCoverDeposit` transaction.
5. The Loan Broker and Borrower create a `Loan` object with a `LoanSet` transaction and the requested principal (excluding fees) is transered to the Borrower.
6. If the Borrower fails to pay the Loan, the Loan Broker can default the `Loan` using the `LoanManage` transaction.
7. Once the Loan has matured (or defaulted), the Borrower or the Loan Broker can delete it using a `LoanDelete` transaction.
8. Optionally, the Loan Broker can withdraw the First-Loss Capital using the `LoanBrokerCoverWithdraw` transaction.
9. When all `Loan` objects are deleted, the Loan Broker can delete the `LoanBroker` object with a `LoanBrokerDelete` transaction.
10. When all `LoanBroker` objects are deleted, the Loan Broker can delete the `Vault` object.

### 1.2 Compliance Features

### 1.2.1 Clawback

Clawback is a mechanism by which an asset Issuer (IOU or MPT, not XRP) claws back the funds. The Issuer may clawback funds from the First-Loss Capital.

### 1.2.2 Freeze

Freeze is a mechanism by which an asset Issuer (IOUT or MPT, not XRP) freezes an `Account`, preventing that account from sending the Asset. Deep Freeze is a mechanism by which an asset Issuer prevents and `Account` from both sending and receiving and Asset. Finally, an Issuer may enact a global freeze, which prevents everyone from sending or receiving the Asset. Note that in both single-account and global freezes, the Asset can be sent to the Issuer.

If the Issuer freezes a Borrower's account, the Borrower cannot make loan payments. However, a frozen account does not lift the obligation to repay a Loan. If the Issuer Deep Freezes a Borrower's account, the Brrower cannot make loan payments.

A Deep Freeze does not affect the Loan Broker's functions. However, a Deep Freeze will prevent the Loan Broker from receing any Lending Protocol Fees.

The Issuer may also Freeze of Deep Freeze the `_pseudo-account_` of the Loan Broker. A Freeze on the `_pseudo-account_` will prevent the Loan Broker from creating new Loans. However existing Loans will not be affected. In contrast, a Deep Freeze, will also prevent the Loans from being paid.

### 1.3 Risk Management

Risk management involves mechanisms that mitigate the risks associated with lending. To protect investors' assets, we have introduced an optional first-loss capital protection scheme. This scheme requires the Loan Broker to deposit a fund that can be partially liquidated to cover losses in the event of a loan default. The amount of first-loss capital required is a percentage of the total debt owed to the Vault. In case of a default, a portion of the first-loss capital will be liquidated based on the minimum required cover. The liquidated capital is placed back into the Vault to cover some of the loss.

### 1.4 Interest Rates

There are three basic interest rates associated with a Loan:

- **`Interest Rate`**: The regular interest rate based on the principal amount. It is the cost of borrowing funds.
- **`Late Interest Rate`**: A higher interest rate charged for a late payment.
- **`Full Payment Rate`**: An interest rate charged for repaying the total Loan early.

### 1.5 Fees

The lending protocol charges a number of fees that the Loan Broker can configure. The protocol will not charge the fees if the Loan Broker has not deposited enough First-Loss Capital.

- **`Management Fee`**: This is a fee charged by the Loan Broker, calculated as a percentage of the interest earned on loans. It's deducted from the interest that would otherwise go to the Vault depositors. Essentially, borrowers pay the full interest, but before that interest reaches depositors, the Loan Broker takes their cut.
- **`Loan Origination Fee`**: A nominal fee paid to the Loan Broker taken from the principal lent.
- **`Loan Service Fee`**: A nominal fee paid on top of each loan payment.
- **`Late Payment Fee`**: A nominal fee paid on top of a late payment.
- **`Early Payment Fee`**: A nominal fee paid on top of an early payment.

### 1.6 Terminology

#### 1.6.1 Terms

- **`Fixed-Term Loan`**: A type of Loan with a known end date and a constant periodic payment schedule.
- **`Principal`**: The original sum of money borrowed that must be repaid, excluding interest or other fees.
- **`Interest`**: The cost of borrowing the Asset, calculated as a percentage of the loan principal, which the Borrower pays to the Lender over time.
- **`Default`**: The failure by the Borrower to meet the obligations of a loan, such as missing payments.
- **`First-Loss Capital`**: The portion of capital that absorbs initial losses in case of a Default, protecting the Vault from loss.
- **`Term`**: The period over which a Borrower must repay the Loan.
- **`Amortization`**: The gradual repayment of a loan through scheduled payments that cover both interest and principal over time.
- **`Repayment Schedule`**: A detailed plan that outlines when and how much a borrower must pay to repay the Loan fLoan.
- **`Grace Period`**: A set period after the Loan's due date after which the Loan Broker can default the Loan

#### 1.6.2 Actors

- **`LoanBroker`**: The entity issuing the Loan.
- **`Borrower`**: The account that is borrowing funds.

## 2. Ledger Entries

### 2.1. LoanBroker Ledger Entry

The `LoanBroker` object captures attributes of the Lending Protocol.

#### 2.1.1 Object Identifier

The key of the `LoanBroker` object is the result of [`SHA512-Half`](https://xrpl.org/docs/references/protocol/data-types/basic-data-types/#hashes) of the following values concatenated in order:

- The `LoanBroker` space key `0x006C` (Lower-case `l`).
- The `AccountID`(<https://xrpl.org/docs/references/protocol/binary-format/#accountid-fields>) of the account submitting the `LoanBrokerSet` transaction, i.e. `Lender`.
- The transaction `Sequence` number. If the transaction used a [Ticket](https://xrpl.org/docs/concepts/accounts/tickets/), use the `TicketSequence` value.

#### 2.1.2 Fields

The `LoanBroker` object has the following fields:

| Field Name             | User Modifiable? | Constant? |      Required?      | JSON Type | Internal Type | Default Value | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

#### 2.1.3 `LoanBroker` _pseudo-account_

The `LoanBroker` _pseudo-account_ holds the First-Loss Capital deposited by the LoanBroker, as well as Loan funds. The _pseudo-account_ follows the XLS-64d specification for pseudo accounts. The `AccountRoot` object is created when creating the `Vault` object.

#### 2.1.4 Ownership

The lending protocol object is stored in the ledger and tracked in an [Owner Directory](https://xrpl.org/docs/references/protocol/ledger-data/ledger-entry-types/directorynode) owned by the account submitting the `LoanBrokerSet` transaction. Furthermore, the object is also tracked in the `OwnerDirectory` of the `Vault` _`pseudo-account`_. The `_pseudo_account_` `OwnerDirectory` page is captured by the `VaultNode` field.

The `RootIndex` of the `DirectoryNode` object is the result of [`SHA512-Half`](https://xrpl.org/docs/references/protocol/data-types/basic-data-types/#hashes) of the following values concatenated in order:

- The `OwnerDirectory` space key `0x004F`
- The `LoanBrokerID`

#### 2.1.5 Reserves

The `LoanBroker` object costs two owner reserve for the account creating it.

#### 2.1.6 Accounting

The Lending Protocol tracks the funds owed to the associated Vault in the `DebtTotal` attribute. It captures the principal amount taken from the Vault and the interest due, excluding all fees. The `DebtMaximum` attribute controls the maximum debt a Lending Protocol may incur. Whenever the Lender issues a Loan, `DebtTotal` is incremented by the Loan principal and interest, excluding fees. When $DebtTotal \geq DebtMaximum$, the Lender cannot issue new loans until some of the debt is cleared. Furthermore, the Lender may not issue a loan that would cause the `DebtTotal` to exceed `DebtMaximum`.

#### 2.1.7 First-Loss Capital

The First-Loss Capital is an optional mechanism to protect the Vault depositors from incurring a loss in case of a Loan default. The first loss of capital absorbs some of the loss. The following parameters control the First-Loss Capital:

- `CoverAvailable` - the total amount of cover deposited by the Lending Protocol Owner.
- `CoverRateMinimum` - the percentage of `DebtTotal` that must be covered by the `CoverAvailable`.
- `CoverRateLiquidation` - the maximum percentage of the minimum required cover ($DebtTotal \times CoverRateMinimum$) that will be liquidated to cover a Loan Default.

Whenever the available cover falls below the minimum cover required, two consequences occur:

- The Lender cannot issue new Loans.
- The Lender cannot directly receive fees. The fees are instead added to the First Loss Capital to cover the deficit.

**Examples**

```
Example 1: Loan Default

** Initial States **

-- Vault --
AssetsTotal             = 100,090 Tokens
AssetsAvailable         = 99,000 Tokens

-- Lending Protocol --
DebtTotal               = 1,090 Tokens
CoverRateMinimum        = 0.1 (10%)
CoverRateLiquidation    = 0.1 (10%)
CoverAvailable          = 1,000 Tokens

-- Loan --
PrincipleOutstanding  = 1,000 Tokens
InterestOutstanding   = 90 Tokens


# First-Loss Capital liquidation maths

DefaultAmount = PrincipleOutstanding + InterestOutstanding
              = 1,000 + 90
              = 1,090

# The amount of the default that the first-loss capital scheme will cover
DefaultCovered      = min((DebtTotal x CoverRateMinimum) x CoverRateLiquidation, DefaultAmount)
                    = min((1,090 * 0.1) * 0.1, 1,090) = min(10.9, 1,090)
                    = 10.9 Tokens

Loss                = DefaultAmount - DefaultCovered
                    = 1,090 - 10.9
                    = 1,079.1 Tokens

FundsReturned       = DefaultCovered
                    = 10.9

# Note, Loss + FundsReturned MUST be equal to PrincipleOutstanding + InterestOutstanding

### 2.2. `Loan` Ledger Entry

A Loan ledger entry captures various Loan terms on-chain. It is an agreement between the Borrower and the loan issuer.

#### 2.2.1 Object Identifier

The `LoanID` is calculated as follows:

- Calculate [`SHA512-Half`](https://xrpl.org/docs/references/protocol/data-types/basic-data-types/#hashes) of the following values:
  - The `Loan` space key `0x004C` (capital L)
  - The [`AccountID`](https://xrpl.org/docs/references/protocol/binary-format/#accountid-fields) of the Borrower account.
  - The `LoanBrokerID` of the associated `LoanBroker` object.
  - The `LoanSequence` of the `LoanBroker` object.

It is determined based on the total loan value at creation time. |

##### 2.2.2.1 Flags

The `Loan` object supports the following flags:

| Flag Name            |  Flag Value  | Modifiable? |                      Description                       |
| -------------------- | :----------: | :---------: | :----------------------------------------------------: |
| `lsfLoanDefault`     | `0x00010000` |    `No`     |     If set, indicates that the Loan is defaulted.      |
| `lsfLoanImpaired`    | `0x00020000` |    `Yes`    |      If set, indicates that the Loan is impaired.      |
| `lsfLoanOverpayment` | `0x00040000` |    `No`     | If set, indicates that the Loan supports overpayments. |

##### 2.2.2.2 TotalValueOutstanding

The total outstanding value of the Loan, including all fees. To calculate the outstanding interest portion, use this formula: `TotalInterestOutstanding = TotalValueOutstanding - PrincipalOutstanding - ManagementFeeOutstanding`.

##### 2.2.2.3 PrincipalOutstanding

The principal amount that the Borrower still owes. This amount decreases each time the borrower makes a successful loan payment. This field ensures that the loan is fully settled on the final payment.

##### 2.2.2.4 ManagementFeeOutstanding

The remaining Management Fee owed to the LoanBroker. This amount decreases each time the borrower makes a successful loan payment. This field ensures that the loan is fully settled on the final payment.

##### 2.2.2.5 PeriodicPayment

The periodic payment amount represents the precise sum the Borrower must pay during each payment cycle. For practical implementation, this value should be rounded UP when processing payments. The system automatically recalculates the PeriodicPayment following any overpayment by the borrower. For instance, when dealing with MPT loans, the calculated `PeriodicPayment` may be `10.251`. However, since MPTs only support whole number representations, the borrower would need to pay `12` units. The system maintains the precise periodic payment value at maximum accuracy since it is frequently referenced throughout loan payment computations.

#### 2.2.3 Ownership

The `Loan` objects are stored in the ledger and tracked in two [Owner Directories](https://xrpl.org/docs/references/protocol/ledger-data/ledger-entry-types/directorynode).

- The `OwnerNode` is the `Owner Directory` of the `Borrower` who is the main `Owner` of the `Loan` object, and therefore is responsible for the owner reserve.
- The `LoanBrokerNode` is the `Owner Directory` for the `LoanBroker` _pseudo-account_ to track all loans associated with the same `LoanBroker` object.

#### 2.2.4 Reserves

The `Loan` object costs one owner reserve for the `Borrower`.

#### 2.2.5 Loan Total Value

The loan's financial state is tracked through three key components:

- **PrincipalOutstanding**: Represents the remaining principal balance that the borrower must repay to satisfy the original loan amount.
- **TotalValueOutstanding**: Encompasses the complete remaining loan obligation, comprising both the outstanding principal and all scheduled interest payments based on the original amortization schedule. This value excludes any additional interest charges resulting from late payments.
- **InterestOutstanding**: The total scheduled interest remaining on the loan, derived as `TotalValueOutstanding - PrincipalOutstanding`.

**Asset-Specific Precision Handling**: For discrete asset types (MPTs and XRP denominated in drops), both `TotalValueOutstanding` and `PrincipalOutstanding` values are truncated to whole numbers to ensure compatibility with the underlying asset precision requirements.

**Late Payment Interest Treatment**: Late payment penalties and additional interest charges are calculated and collected separately from the core loan value. These charges do not modify the `TotalValueOutstanding` calculation, which remains anchored to the original scheduled payment terms.

#### 2.2.6 Impairment

When the Loan Broker discovers that the Borower cannot make an upcoming payment, impairment allows the Loan Broker to register a "paper loss" with the Vault. The impairment mechanism moves the Next Payment Due Date to the time the Loan was impaired, allowing to default the Loan more quickly. However, if the Borrower makes a payment, the impairment status is automatically cleared.

| ------------------- | :----------: | :--------------------------------------------- |
| `tfLoanOverpayment` | `0x00010000` | Indicates that the loan supports overpayments. |

##### 3.2.1.2 `CounterpartySignature`

An inner object that contains the signature of the Lender over the transaction. The fields contained in this object are:

| Field Name      | Required? | JSON Type | Internal Type | Default Value | Description                                                                                                        |
| --------------- | :-------: | :-------: | :-----------: | :-----------: | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `SigningPubKey` |           | `string`  |   `STBlob`    |     `N/A`     | The Public Key to be used to verify the validity of the signature.                                                 |
| `TxnSignature`  |           | `string`  |   `STBlob`    |     `N/A`     | The signature of over all signing fields.                                                                          |
| `Signers`       |           |  `list`   |   `STArray`   |     `N/A`     | An array of transaction signatures from the `Counterparty` signers to indicate their approval of this transaction. |

The final transaction must include exactly one of

1. The `SigningPubKey` and `TxnSignature` fields, or
2. The `Signers` field and, optionally, an empty `SigningPubKey`.

The total fee for the transaction will be increased due to the extra signatures that need to be processed, similar to the additional fees for multisigning. The minimum fee will be $(|signatures| + 1) \times base_fee$ where $|signatures| == max(1, |tx.CounterPartySignature.Signers|)$

The total fee calculation for signatures will now be $(1 + |tx.Signers| + |signatures|) \times base_fee$. In other words, even without a `tx.Signers` list, the minimum fee will be $2 \times base_fee$.

This field is not a signing field (it will not be included in transaction signatures, though the `TxnSignature` or `Signers` field will be included in the stored transaction).

##### 3.2.1.3 Multi-Signing

The `LoanSet` transaction is a mutual agreement between the `Borrower` and the `LoanBroke.Owner` to create a Loan. Therefore, the `LoanSet` transaction must be signed by both parties.

Either of the parties (Borrower or Loan Issuer) may initiate the transaction. The user flow is as follows:

- `Borrower` initiates the transaction:

  1. The `Borrower` creates the transaction from their account, setting the pre-agreed terms.

     - Optionally, the `Borrower` may set the `Counterparty` to `LoanBroker.Owner`. In case the `Counterparty` field is not set, it is assumed to be the `LoanBroker.Owner`.

  2. The `Borrower` signs the transaction setting the `SigningPubKey`, `TxnSignature`, `Signers`, `Account`, `Fee`, `Sequence` fields.
  3. The `Borrower` sends the transaction to the `Loan Issuer`.
  4. The `Loan Issuer` verifies the loan-terms are as agreed upon and verifies the signature of the `Borrower`.
  5. The `Loan Issuer` signs the transaction, filling the `CounterpartySignature` field.
  6. The `Loan Issuer` submits the transaction.

- `Loan Issuer` initiates the transaction:

  1. The `Loan Issuer` creates the transaction from their account setting the pre-agreed terms.

     - The `Loan Issuer` must set the `Counterparty` to the `Borrower` account ID.

  2. The `Loan Issuer` signs the transaction setting the `SigningPubKey`, `TxnSignature`, `Signers`, `Account`, `Fee`, `Sequence` fields.
  3. The `Loan Issuer` sends the transaction to the `Borrower`.
  4. The `Borrower` verifies the loan-terms are as agreed upon and verifies the signature of the `Loan Issuer`.
  5. The `Borrower` signs the transaction, filling the `CounterpartySignature` field.
  6. The `Borrower` submits the transaction.

##### 3.2.1.4 Fees

The account specified in the `Account` field pays the transaction fee.

##### 3.2.1.5 Failure Conditions

- `LoanBroker` object with the specified `LoanBrokerID` does not exist on the ledger.
- If neither the `Account` or the `Counterparty` field are the `LoanBroker.Owner`.
- If the `Counterparty` field is not specified and the `CounterpartySignature` is not from the `LoanBroker.Owner`.
- If the `Counterparty.TxnSignature` is invalid.

- If the `Vault(LoanBroker(LoanBrokerID).VaultID).Asset` is an `IOU`:

  - The `AccountRoot` object of the `Issuer` has the `lsfGlobalFreeze` flag set.
  - The `AccountRoot` object of the `Issuer` has the `lsfRequireAuth` flag set, and the `RippleState` object between the `Issuer` and the Borrower does not have the `lsfLowAuth` and `lsfHighAuth` flags set.

  - The `RippleState` between the `LoanBroker.Account` and the `Issuer` has the `lsfLowDeepFreeze` or `lsfHighDeepFreeze` flag set. (The Loan Broker _pseudo-account_ is frozen).
  - The `RippleState` between the `Vault(LoanBroker(LoanBrokerID).VaultID).Account` and the `Issuer` has the `lsfLowFreeze` or `lsfHighFreeze` flag set. (The Vault _pseudo-account_ is frozen).

  - The `RippleState` object between the Borrower account and the `Issuer` of the asset has the `lsfLowDeepFreeze` or `lsfHighDeepFreeze` flag set (The borrower cannot send and receive funds).
  - The `RippleState` object between the Borrower account and the `Issuer` of the asset has the `lsfLowFreeze` or `lsfHighFreeze` flag set (The borrower cannot send funds).

- If the `Vault(LoanBroker(LoanBrokerID).VaultID).Asset` is an `MPT`:

  - The `MPTokenIssuance` object of the `Vault(LoanBroker(LoanBrokerID).VaultID).Asset` has the `lsfMPTLocked` flag set.
  - The `MPTokenIssuance` object of the `Vault(LoanBroker(LoanBrokerID).VaultID).Asset` has the `lsfMPTRequireAuth` flag set and the `MPToken`of the Borrower `AccountRoot` does not have the `lsfMPTAuthorized` flag set.

  - The `MPToken` object for the `Vault(LoanBroker(LoanBrokerID).VaultID).Asset` of the `LoanBroker.Account` `AccountRoot` has `lsfMPTLocked` flag set. (The Loan Broker _pseudo-account_ is locked).
  - The `MPToken` object for the `Vault(LoanBroker(LoanBrokerID).VaultID).Asset` of the `Vault(LoanBroker(LoanBrokerID).VaultID).Account` `AccountRoot` has `lsfMPTLocked` flag set. (The Vault _pseudo-account_ is locked).

  - The `MPToken` object for the `Vault(LoanBroker(LoanBrokerID).VaultID).Asset` of the Borrower `AccountRoot` has `lsfMPTLocked` flag set (The Borrower MPToken is locked).

- Either of the `tfLoanDefault`, `tfLoanImpair` or `tfLoanUnimpair` flags are set.

- The `Borrower` `AccountRoot` object does not exist.

- `PaymentInterval` is less than `60` seconds.
- `GracePeriod` is greater than the `PaymentInterval`.

- The combination of `PrincipalRequested`, `InterestRate`, `PaymentTotal`, and `PaymentInterval` results in a total interest amount that is zero or negative due to precision limitations. This can happen if the loan term is too short or the principal is too small for any interest to accrue to a representable value.
- The loan terms result in a periodic payment that is too small to cover the interest accrued in the first period, leaving no amount to pay down the principal. This prevents the loan from being amortized correctly.
- The calculated periodic payment is so small that it rounds down to zero when adjusted for the asset's precision (e.g., drops for XRP, or the smallest unit of an IOU/MPT).
- The rounding of the periodic payment (due to asset precision) is significant enough that the total number of payments required to settle the loan is less than the specified `PaymentTotal`.

- Insufficient assets in the Vault:

  - `Vault(LoanBroker(LoanBrokerID).VaultID).AssetsAvailable` < `Loan.PrincipalRequested`.

- Exceeds maximum Debt of the LoanBroker:

  - `LoanBroker(LoanBrokerID).DebtMaximum` < `LoanBroker(LoanBrokerID).DebtTotal + Loan.PrincipalRequested + (TotalInterestOutstanding() - (TotalInterestOutstanding() x LoanBroker.ManagementFeeRate)`

- Insufficient First-Loss Capital:

  - `LoanBroker(LoanBrokerID).CoverAvailable` < `(LoanBroker(LoanBrokerID).DebtTotal + Loan.PrincipalRequested + (TotalInterestOutstanding() - (TotalInterestOutstanding() x LoanBroker.ManagementFeeRate)) x LoanBroker(LoanBrokerID).CoverRateMinimum`

    - Increase the `RippleState` balance between the `LoanBroker` _pseudo-account_ `AccountRoot` and the `Issuer` `AccountRoot` by `Loan.LoanOriginationFee` (the loan origination fee was added to First Loss Capital, and thus transfered to the `LoanBroker` _pseudo-account_).
    - Increase `LoanBroker.CoverAvailable` by `Loan.LoanOriginationFee`.

  - Otherwise:

    - Increase the `RippleState` balance between the `LoanBroker.Owner` `AccountRoot` and the `Issuer` `AccountRoot` by `Loan.LoanOriginationFee`.

  - Create an `MPToken` object for the `Borrower` if one does not exist.

  - Decrease the `MPToken.MPTAmount` of the `Vault` _pseudo-account_ `MPToken` object for the `Vault.Asset` by `Loan.PrincipalRequested`.

    - Increase `LoanBroker.CoverAvailable` by `Loan.LoanOriginationFee`.

  - Otherwise:

##### 3.2.4.2 Payment Processing

A `LoanPay` transaction is processed according to a defined workflow that evaluates the payment's timing, amount, and any specified flags. This determines how the funds are applied to the loan's principal, interest, and associated fees.

**Source of Truth**: The formulas in this section describe the financial theory for a conceptual understanding. The [pseudo-code](#3244-transaction-pseudo-code) describes the required implementation logic, which includes critical adjustments for rounding. **Implementations must follow the pseudo-code.**

**Payment Rounding**: The `Loan.PeriodicPayment` field stores a high-precision value. However, payments must be made in the discrete, indivisible units of the loan's asset (e.g., XRP drops, whole MPTs, or the smallest unit of an IOU). Therefore, the borrower is expected to make a periodic payment that is rounded **up** to the asset's scale.

For example:

- If a loan is denominated in an asset that only supports whole numbers (like an MPT) and the calculated `Loan.PeriodicPayment` is `10.12345`, the borrower is expected to pay `11`.
- If a loan is denominated in a USD IOU with two decimal places of precision and the `Loan.PeriodicPayment` is `25.54321`, the borrower is expected to pay `25.55`.

This rounded-up value, plus any applicable service fees, constitutes the minimum payment for a single period.

Each payment consists of three components:

- **Principal**: The portion that reduces the outstanding loan principle.
- **Interest**: The portion that covers the cost of borrowing for the period.
- **Fees**: The portion that covers any applicable `serviceFee`, `managementFee`, `latePaymentFee`, or other charges.

The system follows these steps to process a payment:

1.  **Timing Verification**: The transaction is first classified as either **On-time** or **Late** by comparing the ledger's close time to the `Loan.NextPaymentDueDate`.

2.  **Minimum Amount Validation**: The payment is checked against the minimum amount required for its timing classification. If the amount is insufficient, the transaction is rejected.

    - **Late Minimum**: `periodicPayment + serviceFee + latePaymentFee + lateInterest`
    - **On-time Minimum**: `periodicPayment + serviceFee`

3.  **Scenario Handling**: Based on the timing and transaction flags, the system proceeds with one of the following paths:

    - **A) Late Payment Processing**: If the payment is late, it must be for the exact amount calculated by the [late payment formula](#32422-late-payment).

      - **Constraint**: Overpayments are not permitted on late payments. Any amount paid beyond the exact total due will be ignored.

    - **B) On-Time Payment Processing**: If the payment is on-time, the system checks for special repayment scenarios before handling standard periodic payments.
      - **i. Full Early Repayment**: If the `tfLoanFullPayment` flag is set and the amount is sufficient to cover the [full payment formula](#32424-early-full-repayment), the loan is closed.
        - **Constraint**: This option is not available if only one payment remains on the loan.
      - **ii. Sequential Periodic Payments**: If it is not a full repayment, the system applies the funds to as many complete periodic payment cycles as possible. A single cycle consists of the `periodicPayment` plus the `serviceFee`.
      - **iii. Overpayment Application**: After all possible full periodic cycles are paid, any remaining amount is treated as an overpayment and applied to the principal.
        - **Constraint**: This step only occurs for on-time payments and requires two flags to be set: `lsfLoanOverpayment` on the `Loan` object and `tfLoanOverpayment` on the `LoanPay` transaction. If these conditions are not met, the excess amount is ignored.

**Note on Excess Funds**: In scenarios where funds are "ignored" (e.g., an overpayment on a late payment, or on a loan that does not permit overpayments), the transaction succeeds, the borrower is only charged the expected due amount, but not the excess.

**The `valueChange` Concept**

The `valueChange` is a critical accounting mechanism that represents the change in the _total future interest_ the vault expects to earn from the loan. It is triggered by events that alter the original amortization schedule.

- **Late Payment**: Adds new penalty interest, so `valueChange` is positive.
- **Overpayment**: Overpayment reduces principal, and thus the future interest, thus `valueChange` is negative.
- **Early Full Payment**: The `valueChange` for an early repayment can be either positive or negative, depending on the size of the early full payment configuration.

This `valueChange` is always split between the Vault (as a change in its net interest) and the Loan Broker (as a change in the `managementFee`).

###### 3.2.4.2.1 Regular Payment

For a standard, on-time payment, the total amount due from the borrower is the sum of the calculated periodic payment and applicable service fee.

$$
totalDue = periodicPayment + loanServiceFee
$$

The `periodicPayment` is calculated using the standard amortization formula, which ensures a constant payment amount over the life of the loan. This payment covers both the interest accrued for the period and a portion of the principal.

$$
periodicPayment = principalOutstanding \times \frac{periodicRate \times (1 + periodicRate)^{PaymentRemaining}}{(1 + periodicRate)^{PaymentRemaining} - 1}
$$

The `periodicRate` is the interest rate applied for each payment interval, derived from the annual rate:

$$
periodicRate = \frac{interestRate \times paymentInterval}{365 \times 24 \times 60 \times 60}
$$

From the calculated `periodicPayment`, the specific `interest` and `principal` portions for that period can be derived as follows:

$$
interest = principalOutstanding \times periodicRate
$$

$$
principal = periodicPayment - interest
$$

**Special Handling for the Final Payment**

When only a single payment remains (`PaymentRemaining = 1`), the standard amortization formula is overridden. Instead, the final `periodicPayment` is set to the exact `TotalValueOutstanding` (which is the sum of the remaining `principalOutstanding`, `interestOutstanding`, and `managementFeeOutstanding`).

This crucial adjustment prevents "residual dust", small leftover amounts caused by the cumulative effect of rounding individual payments over the loan's term (e.g., truncating fractions for XRP drops or MPTs). Without this override, the final formula-calculated payment might not perfectly match the remaining balance, making it impossible to fully clear the debt.

Formally:

```
If PaymentRemaining > 1:
  periodicPayment = result from amortization formula (rounded per asset rules)
If PaymentRemaining = 1:
  periodicPayment = TotalValueOutstanding (the sum of all remaining balances)
```

Example (integer-only MPT):

- Initial TotalValueOutstanding = 11 MPT
- PaymentTotal = 10
- Amortization produces periodicPayment = 1.1 MPT
- Asset supports only whole units ⇒ each scheduled payment is truncated to 1 MPT
  Progress:
  After 9 payments: Paid = 9 MPT, Remaining TotalValueOutstanding = 2 MPT
  If we applied the formula again for the 10th payment:
  periodicPayment (unrounded) = 1.1 MPT → truncated to 1 MPT
  Remaining after payment = 1 MPT (cannot be repaid; no payments left)
  Adjustment:
  Because PaymentRemaining = 1, set periodicPayment = TotalValueOutstanding = 2 MPT
  Final payment = 2 MPT clears the loan exactly (PrincipalOutstanding = 0, TotalValueOutstanding = 0).

Therefore, implementations must detect the single remaining payment case and substitute the outstanding value to guarantee full extinguishment of the debt.

###### 3.2.4.2.2 Late Payment

When a Borrower makes a payment after `NextPaymentDueDate`, they must pay the standard `periodicPayment` plus a nominal `latePaymentFee` and additional penalty interest (`latePaymentInterest`) for the overdue period.

The total amount due is calculated as:

$$
totalDue = periodicPayment + loanServiceFee + latePaymentFee + latePaymentInterest
$$

The penalty interest is calculated based on the number of seconds the payment is overdue:

$$
secondsOverdue = lastLedgerCloseTime - Loan.NextPaymentDueDate
$$

$$
latePeriodicRate = \frac{lateInterestRate \times secondsOverdue}{365 \times 24 \times 60 \times 60}
$$

$$
latePaymentInterest_{gross} = principalOutstanding \times latePeriodicRate
$$

A portion of this gross late interest is allocated to the Loan Broker as a management fee. The remaining net interest increases the total value of the loan.

$$
managementFee_{late} = latePaymentInterest_{gross} \times managementFeeRate
$$

The change in the total loan value is equent to the late payment interest, excluding any fees.

$$
valueChange = latePaymentInterest_{gross} - managementFee_{late}
$$

This `valueChange` represents the net increase in the loan's value, which must be reflected in `Vault.AssetsTotal`. However, this value change is not reflected in `Loan.TotalValueOutstanding` and `LoanBroker.DebtTotal` fields. It is an unanticipated increase in value. Note that `valueChange > 0` for late payments.

###### 3.2.4.2.3 Loan Overpayment

An overpayment occurs when an on-time payment exceeds the amount required for one or more periodic payments. The excess amount is used to pay down the principal early, which reduces the total future interest owed. This process involves two key calculations: charging fees on the overpayment itself and re-amortizing the loan.

**1. Processing the Overpayment Amount**

First, fees and interest are calculated on the `overpaymentAmount` (the funds remaining after all full periodic payments are settled).

$$
overpaymentInterest_{gross} = overpaymentAmount \times overpaymentInterestRate
$$

A management fee is taken from this interest:

$$
managementFee_{overpayment} = overpaymentInterest_{gross} \times managementFeeRate
$$

$$
overpaymentInterest_{net} = overpaymentInterest_{gross} - managementFee_{overpayment}
$$

A percentage fee may also be charged:

$$
overpaymentFee = overpaymentAmount \times overpaymentFee
$$

The portion of the overpayment that will be applied directly to the principal is:

$$
principalPortion = overpaymentAmount - overpaymentInterest_{net} - managementFee_{overpayment} - overpaymentFee
$$

**2. Re-Amortizing the Loan and Calculating `valueChange`**

Applying the `principalPortion` to the loan reduces the `PrincipalOutstanding`, which in turn changes the amortization schedule and the total interest that will be paid over the remainder of the loan's term. This change in total future interest is the primary `valueChange`.

The system performs the following logical steps (as detailed in the `do_overpayment` pseudo-code):

1.  The `principalPortion` is subtracted from the current `PrincipalOutstanding` to get a `newPrincipalOutstanding`.
2.  A `newPeriodicPayment` is calculated using the standard amortization formula based on the `newPrincipalOutstanding` and the `paymentsRemaining`.
3.  A `newTotalValueOutstanding` is calculated based on the `newPeriodicPayment` and `paymentsRemaining`.
4.  The `valueChange` is the difference between the old and new total future interest, adjusted for any existing rounding discrepancies to ensure numerical stability.

The total change in the loan's value from an overpayment is the sum of the net interest charged on the overpayment and the value change from re-amortization.

$$
valueChange = overpaymentInterest_{net} + valueChange_{re-amortization}
$$

Note, that an overpayment typically decreases the overall value of the loan, as the reduction in future interest from re-amortization outweighs interest charged on the overpayment amount itself. However, it is possible for an overpayment to increase the value, if the overpayment interest portion is greater than the value change caused by re-amortization.

###### 3.2.4.2.4 Early Full Repayment

A Borrower can close a Loan early by submitting the total amount needed to do so. This amount is the sum of the outstanding principal, any interest accrued since the last payment, a prepayment penalty, and a fixed prepayment fee.

$$
totalDue = principalOutstanding + accruedInterest + prepaymentPenalty + ClosePaymentFee
$$

The interest accrued since the last payment is calculated pro-rata:

$$
secondsSinceLastPayment = lastLedgerCloseTime - max(Loan.previousPaymentDate, Loan.startDate)
$$

$$
accruedInterest = principalOutstanding \times periodicRate \times \frac{secondsSinceLastPayment}{paymentInterval}
$$

The Lender may also charge a prepayment penalty, calculated as a percentage of the outstanding principal:

$$
prepaymentPenalty = principalOutstanding \times closeInterestRate
$$

Because the borrower is not paying all of the originally scheduled future interest, the total value of the loan asset changes. This `valueChange` is the difference between the interest and penalties the vault _will receive_ versus the interest it _expected_ to receive.

The total interest and penalties collected are `accruedInterest + prepaymentPenalty`. The total interest that was expected is `interestOutstanding`.

Therefore, the change in the loan's value is calculated as:

$$
valueChange = (accruedInterest + prepaymentPenalty) - interestOutstanding
$$

The `valueChange` for an early repayment can be either positive or negative, depending on the size of the `prepaymentPenalty` relative to the `interestOutstanding`.

- If `(accruedInterest + prepaymentPenalty) < interestOutstanding`, the `valueChange` will be negative, reflecting a decrease in the total value of the loan asset because the vault receives less interest than originally scheduled.
- If `(accruedInterest + prepaymentPenalty) > interestOutstanding`, the `valueChange` will be positive. This can occur if the lender imposes a significant prepayment penalty that exceeds the forgiven future interest.

This change in value must be reflected in `Vault.AssetsTotal` and `LoanBroker.DebtTotal`, accounting for the corresponding change in the `managementFee`.

##### 3.2.4.3 Conceptual Loan Value

The value of a loan is based on the present value of its future payments. Conceptually, this can be understood through the standard amortization formulas.

The `periodicPayment` is the constant amount required to pay off the `principalOutstanding` over the `PaymentRemaining` intervals at the given `periodicRate`.

$$
periodicPayment = principalOutstanding \times \frac{periodicRate \times (1 + periodicRate)^{PaymentRemaining}}{(1 + periodicRate)^{PaymentRemaining} - 1}
$$

From this, the theoretical `totalValueOutstanding` is the sum of all remaining payments.

$$
\text{Theoretical } totalValueOutstanding = periodicPayment \times PaymentRemaining
$$

And the theoretical `totalInterestOutstanding` is the portion of that total value that is not principal.

$$
\text{Theoretical } totalInterestOutstanding = \text{Theoretical } totalValueOutstanding - principalOutstanding
$$

**Important Note**: These formulas describe the theoretical financial model. The actual values stored on the `Loan` ledger object (`TotalValueOutstanding`, `PrincipalOutstanding`, `ManagementFeeOutstanding`) are continuously adjusted during payment processing to account for asset-specific rounding rules. Therefore, implementations **must not** rely on these formulas to derive the live state of a loan. The stored ledger fields are the single source of truth.

  - The `MPTokenIssuance` object of the `Vault(LoanBroker(Loan(LoanID).LoanBrokerID).VaultID).Asset` has the `lsfMPTLocked` flag set.

##### 3.2.4.6 State Changes

Upon successful validation, the `LoanPay` transaction is processed according to the logic defined in the [Transaction Pseudo-code](#3244-transaction-pseudo-code). This process yields four key results: `principalPaid`, `interestPaid`, `feePaid`, and `valueChange`. These values are then used to apply the following state changes.

**1. High-Level Accounting**

First, the system determines the final destination of all funds.

1.  **Determine Fee Destination**: All collected fees are directed to one of two places:

    - **If First-Loss Capital is sufficient** (`LoanBroker.CoverAvailable >= LoanBroker.DebtTotal * LoanBroker.CoverRateMinimum`): The fees are paid to the `LoanBroker.Owner`.
    - **If First-Loss Capital is insufficient**: The fees are added to the first-loss pool to cover the deficit.

2.  **Define Final Fund Flows**:
    - `totalPaidByBorrower = principalPaid + interestPaid + feePaid`
    - `totalToVault = principalPaid + interestPaid`
    - `totalToBroker` = The total fee amount, directed to either the `LoanBroker.Owner` or the `LoanBroker` pseudo-account's cover pool.

**2. `Loan` Object State Changes**

The `Loan` object is updated to reflect the payment.

- If the loan was impaired (`lsfLoanImpaired` flag was set), the flag is cleared.

- **For a Full Repayment**:

  - All outstanding balance fields (`PrincipalOutstanding`, `TotalValueOutstanding`, `ManagementFeeOutstanding`) are set to `0`.
  - `PaymentRemaining` is set to `0`.

- **For Other Payments**:

  - `PrincipalOutstanding` is decreased by the `principal` portion of each periodic payment settled.
  - `ManagementFeeOutstanding` is decreased by the `managementFee` portion of each periodic payment settled.
  - `TotalValueOutstanding` is decreased by the sum of the `principal`, `interest`, and `managementFee` portions of each periodic payment settled.
  - If an overpayment occurred, `TotalValueOutstanding` is further adjusted by the `valueChange` resulting from re-amortization. It is **not** adjusted for `valueChange` from late payment interest, as that interest was not part of the original loan value.
  - `PaymentRemaining` is decreased by `1` for each full periodic payment cycle covered.
  - `NextPaymentDueDate` is advanced by `Loan.PaymentInterval` for each periodic payment cycle covered.
  - `PreviousPaymentDate` is updated.
  - If an overpayment was made:
    - `PeriodicPayment` is recalculated based on the new outstanding principal and remaining term.

**3. `LoanBroker` and `Vault` Object State Changes**

The `LoanBroker` and `Vault` objects are updated to reflect the new accounting state. The `valueChange`—representing the net change in the loan's total future interest—is applied to both the `LoanBroker` and the `Vault`, but with an important distinction for late payments.

- **`LoanBroker` Updates**:

  - `LoanBroker.DebtTotal` is decreased by `totalToVault` (the principal and interest paid back).
  - If the payment resulted in a `valueChange` from an overpayment or early full repayment, `LoanBroker.DebtTotal` is adjusted by that `valueChange`. It is **not** adjusted for `valueChange` from late payment interest, as this represents a penalty paid directly to the vault, not an alteration of the original debt schedule.
  - If fees were directed to the cover pool, `LoanBroker.CoverAvailable` increases by `totalToBroker`.

- **`Vault` Updates**:
  - `Vault.AssetsAvailable` increases by `totalToVault`.
  - `Vault.AssetsTotal` is always adjusted by the total `valueChange`, reflecting the net change in the vault's expected future earnings from the loan.

**4. Low-Level Asset Transfers**

Finally, the actual asset transfers are executed on the ledger.

- The borrower's balance is **decreased** by `totalPaidByBorrower`.
- The `Vault` pseudo-account's balance is **increased** by `totalToVault`.
- The `LoanBroker.Owner`'s balance OR the `LoanBroker` pseudo-account's balance is **increased** by `totalToBroker`, depending on the fee destination.

These transfers are performed according to the asset type:

- **If the asset is XRP**:
  - The `Balance` of the borrower's `AccountRoot` is decreased.
  - The `Balance` of the `Vault` pseudo-account's `AccountRoot` is increased.
  - The `Balance` of the destination account for fees (`LoanBroker.Owner` or `LoanBroker` pseudo-account) is increased.
- **If the asset is an IOU**:
  - The `RippleState` balance between the borrower and the `Issuer` is decreased.
  - The `RippleState` balance between the `Vault` pseudo-account and the `Issuer` is increased.
  - The `RippleState` balance between the destination account for fees (`LoanBroker.Owner` or `LoanBroker` pseudo-account) and the `Issuer` is increased.
- **If the asset is an MPT**:
  - The `MPTAmount` in the borrower's `MPToken` object is decreased.
  - The `MPTAmount` in the `Vault` pseudo-account's `MPToken` object is increased.
  - The `MPTAmount` in the destination account for fees (`LoanBroker.Owner` or `LoanBroker` pseudo-account) `MPToken` object is increased.

# Appendix

## A-1 F.A.Q.

### A-1.1. What is the `LoanBroker.LoanSequence` field?

A sequential identifier for Loans associated with a LoanBroker object. This value increments with each new Loan created by the broker. Unlike `LoanBroker.OwnerCount`, which tracks the number of currently active Loans, `LoanBroker.LoanSequence` reflects the total number of Loans ever created.

### A-1-2. Why the `LoanBrokerCoverClawback` cannot clawback the full LoanBroker.CoverAvailable amount?

The `LoanBrokerCoverClawback` transaction allows the Issuer to clawback the `LoanBroker` First-Loss Capital, specifically the `LoanBroker.CoverAvailable` amount. The transaction cannot claw back the full CoverAvailable amount because the LoanBroker must maintain a minimum level of first-loss capital to protect depositors. This minimum is calculated as `LoanBroker.DebtTotal * LoanBroker.CoverRateMinimum`. When a `LoanBroker` has active loans, a complete clawback would leave depositors vulnerable to unexpected losses. Therefore, the system ensures that a minimum amount of first-loss capital is always maintained.
